This short documentary presents the life and works of Yiddish poet Ida Maze, an author who sought commitment beyond her personal writings of children's poetry to foster and mentor a substantial community of Yiddish writers in Montreal. The film interweaves an interview with her son, Irving Massey, a literary scholar who has written extensively about his mother's poetry and even translated a body of her work, with archival audio recordings of an event held in honor of Ida Maze at the Jewish Public Library of Montreal in 1956. Together, Irving's eloquent memories of his mother and the praising voices of Ida Maze's colleagues make for a compelling reprise of her life, poetry, and legacy.  </abstract><subjects_controlled><topic>Literature</topic><topic>Books</topic><topic>Poetry</topic><topic>Yiddish language</topic><topic>Childhood</topic><topic>Family history, stories about ancestors</topic><topic>Career and Professional Life</topic><topic>Canada</topic><topic>Jewish community</topic><topic>Urban</topic><topic>Rural</topic><topic>Love, Relationships</topic><topic>Eastern Europe</topic><topic>Yiddish speaker</topic><topic>Yiddish scene</topic></subjects_controlled><subjects_uncontrolled><topic>Irving Massey</topic><topic> Ida Maze</topic><topic> Montreal</topic><topic> Beyond the Books</topic><topic> S.
