Unable to immigrate to the US, they ended up in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1930. The family eventually owned dairy factories and a store, which they lost when the government took over the dairy industry.

He attended kheyder (traditional Jewish religious school) every Sunday with about twenty other boys and learned to read and write Hebrew and prepared for his Bar Mitzvah.

Because his new wife found the lifestyle in the mining town too uncultured and wild, he quit, returned to Santiago, and opened his own machine shop.

Her mother, from Belarus, was the daughter of a shoykhet, a kosher butcher. Penina explains how her grandfather landed in this occupation by convincing the rabbonim to certify him as well as arguing with them for three hours that Zionism would provide a better future for the Jews. Her family stayed in Eastern Europe during World War I and then through the Bolshevik revolution, until they were directly persecuted for Zionist organizing. In January of 1924, right before the United States shut down immigration, the family came to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Penina tells the story of her paternal grandmother, who after having many miscarriages before having Penina’s father, greatly feared losing him to the angel of death. As a result, she didn't speak to her son for the first year of his life in order to “trick” the angel of death. Once the war came, Glazer’s father left his mother at age 15 for the United States.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Penina's father arrived in New York and began working at his uncle’s seltzer factory. She says he was an intelligent man, but like many immigrants did not have access to higher education. Her parents were married in 1933 and began their own family. Penina remembers that they both were well read and multi-lingual, even though neither graduated high school.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The family relocated to Roosevelt, New Jersey, and lived on a cooperative New Deal community.

Her mother, from Belarus, was the daughter of a shoykhet, a kosher butcher. Penina explains how her grandfather landed in this occupation by convincing the rabbonim to certify him as well as arguing with them for three hours that Zionism would provide a better future for the Jews. Her family stayed in Eastern Europe during World War I and then through the Bolshevik revolution, until they were directly persecuted for Zionist organizing. In January of 1924, right before the United States shut down immigration, the family came to New York. Penina tells the story of her paternal grandmother, who after having many miscarriages before having Penina’s father, greatly feared losing him to the angel of death. As a result, she didn't speak to her son for the first year of his life in order to “trick” the angel of death. Once the war came, Glazer’s father left his mother at age 15 for the United States. Penina's father arrived in New York and began working at his uncle’s seltzer factory. She says he was an intelligent man, but like many immigrants did not have access to higher education. Her parents were married in 1933 and began their own family. Penina remembers that they both were well read and multi-lingual, even though neither graduated high school. The family relocated to Roosevelt, New Jersey, and lived on a cooperative New Deal community. Penina  talks extensively about the layout of the neighborhood, its Bauhaus architecture and the “hitching corner,” and concludes that it was a warm and tight-knight Jewish community. Eventually the family would move to Elizabeth, New Jersey, prior to the co-ops closing. She compares the Jewish community in Roosevelt to Elizabeth, she found the later to be more religious than the culturally Jewish community at the co-op.Growing up, Penina's parents encouraged their daughters to pursue higher education.

ethnomusicologist, founder of the Klezmer Conservatory Band, and Chair of Contemporary Improvisation at the New England Conservatory in Boston - was interviewed by Nora Feinstein on July 8, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hankus was born in 1955 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up there in the middle-class Mt. Airy neighborhood. His father’s family immigrated from Podolia, Ukraine, and his mother’s family came from Kishinev in what is now Moldova. His father’s family was in the fabric business, the “rag trade,” and his mother’s family members were musicians. Though his family didn’t live in a particularly Jewish neighborhood, they were involved in the local synagogue and Hankus gravitated toward the comforts of Hebrew school more than to public school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hankus describes beginning to play music as a natural outgrowth of his family background. He was drawn to older forms of music and began playing in bands at synagogue, his first professional gig being at the nearby Hasidic shul (synagogue) for its celebration of a Torah donation. He speaks of an awareness, even as a child, of Yiddish culture that is being supplanted by the introduction of modern Hebrew instruction and Israel as a cultural centerpiece in Jewish life. His education at Hebrew high school opened up possibilities for him, exposing him to powerful examples of Yiddish culture and music, leading him to study Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he became more involved and proficient in jazz, Hankus describes his growing awareness that there was no outlet for the Jewish music scene; it was disappearing from Jewish weddings and was dying out in performance. He held on to the idea that his Jewishness needed expression through music. He describes a cathartic moment in his teens while attending music camp; in hearing the lines of a Bertolt Brecht play – “I feel like a man who carries a brick around to show the world what his house was like” – he made a commitment to rebuild Jewish music. He further describes reconnecting with an uncle who connected him to Old World klezmer primary sources and recordings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hankus talks about teaching improvisation at the New England Conservatory in the late 1970s, in an open stylistic environment, which gave him the freedom to explore and teach klezme and in turn helped spark the klezmer revival movement. He talks of finding inspiration in attending an Irish céilidh (caleigh) and wanting to replicate that experience with Yiddish klezmer. He speaks of concertizing at the Conservatory to an enthusiastic public reception of the music, the forming of the Klezmer Conservatory Band, and the development of klezmer as a living art form. He brought klezmer into the classroom as well as to the concert stage and recording studio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He describes how his musical experience led him to reconnect to Jewish education to provide context for the music. He found the power of music in regaining and reconstructing a cultural identity that was rich in and of itself. He describes the rise of KlezKamp, workshops, and the beginnings of a community of common interest.&lt;br&gt;Hankus talks about developing his skills in conversational Yiddish and his connection to the Yiddish Book Center as a living cultural “home.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He concludes by describing how playing concerts is about seeking out older people, performing as a learning experience, and that young people who perform klezmer should think of themselves as students seeking out the culture and building upon it. He talks about the importance of intergenerationality and that oral tradition is a key component of Jewish culture. For him, the Yiddish Book Center has become a cornerstone of rebuilding culture.

His latest project examines Yiddish musical culture’s role in the clash between Fascism and Communism through the life and work of Lin Jaldati, a Dutch-Jewish Yiddish-singing cabaret singer, who survived the Holocaust and was the last person to see Anne Frank alive. Shneer describes Jaldati as occupying the “middle space between the Holocaust and state-sponsored Yiddish culture in East Germany.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Shneer reflects on his connection to Yiddish and characterizes it as the common thread which ties together all of his interests in twentieth century European, Russian, and Jewish history and culture.

He concludes by reflecting on post-Soviet Jewish life in Moscow. </teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish in the Academy: scholars, language instructors, and students</interview_interview_series><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2010-07-12</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>DavidShneer</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/DavidShneer</ia_url><other_derivation_url>512kb MPEG4: https://archive.org/download/DavidShneer/DavidShneer_512kb.mp4</other_derivation_url><themes>Yiddish teachingYiddish language (feelings of/about, meaning, descriptions of)Yiddish learningScholarshipEducationSoviet UnionWestern EuropeWorld War TwoAnti-SemitismAdvice</themes><uncontroled_themes>steiner internship program; gay synagogue; jewish studies; yiddish music; queer jews; torah queeries; yiddish culture in post-war germany; anti-semitism in russia; advice for yiddish students</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>David Shneer</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>David</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Shneer</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1972</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Los Angeles, CA</narrator_place_of_birth><narrator_deceased>Living</narrator_deceased></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>1703</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1704</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0I5-KL-0Fo</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1053</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/david-early-steiner-internship-experiences-0-old</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1705</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1706</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1707</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1708</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fQ9nOjlUU4</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5620</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/david-shneers-advice-students-yiddish-book-centers-steiner-summer-yiddish-program</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1709</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjSPzT-rmjg</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>6117</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/why-yiddish-0</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>47</interview_id><interview_abstract>Hanan Bordin, Riga-born Yiddish language instructor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the author of Yiddish textbooks, was interviewed by Marcy Blattner on July 13, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in Riga, Latvia, in the former Soviet Union, Hanan states that he heard Yiddish as a child, but did not speak it.

Hanan states that the Yiddish department at the Hebrew University was a very strong, independent department, with important teachers and publications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hanan, asked about his connection to Jewish tradition, describes his grandmother's influence in this part of his life. She prayed, went to synagogue, kept Shabbat, and cooked Jewish dishes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hanan recalls his early years as a teacher in an experimental school for girls in Jerusalem, where he taught Yiddish but did not speak it.

She was adamant about speaking only in Yiddish, and Hanan is thankful to her for his breakthrough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also collaborated with him on his first book, in Yiddish and Hebrew, called Yidish shmuesbikhl (“Yiddish Conversation Book”).

Hanan wrote another two books: one for beginners in Yiddish, which is used at the Hebrew University, and one for advanced Yiddish learners, but it was never published.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hanan enumerates the places where he has taught: he teaches full time at the Hebrew University, where he has several Yiddish classes at different levels, and a Yiddish linguistics class, taught entirely in Yiddish. Hanan has also taught courses at Columbia University, Oxford University, Harvard University, YIVO classes at New York University, courses in Moscow and Birobidzhan, Russia, in Vilna (Vilnius), Lithuania, and at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In discussing his relatives in Israel, Hanan relates a story about his grandmother's nephew, Mula, who had fought in the Russian army in World War II. They thought that he had been killed for desertion and Hanan's grandmother said kaddish (the mourner's prayer) for him every year. In the late 1970s, they began to hear rumors that he was alive in Israel. When Jews from Riga began to immigrate to Israel, Hanan asked some friends of his to try to locate him. Hanan's friends located Mula in the Israeli city of Rehovot, and helped him call the family in Riga. A year later, in 1978, Hanan, his mother, and his grandmother immigrated to Israel and were met at the airport by Mula and his family, and the two friends from Riga.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hanan speaks about his attachment to Vilna, He loves to teach there, and recommends going there to anyone learning Yiddish.

Emma discusses her childhood in the largely Jewish community of Chelmsford, Massachusetts where she gained a “comprehensive Jewish education” at Congregation Shalom.  She began her undergraduate in linguistics at eighteen at the University of Pennsylvania, and found the transition to be a “total culture shock.”  She “took many paths…to get involved with Judaism and Jewish identity” while at the University of Pennsylvania, including studying Judeo-Spanish under Beth Wagner and attending an off-campus Reconstructionist synagogue to be exposed to “a new kind of Judaism.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma then describes how she sees language and linguistics being connected to Jewish identity.  She explains that “language is very connected to culture [and that] they can’t be extracted from one another.”  Her interest in studying linguistics is a reflection of her personal interest in culture, Judaism, and Hebrew, and that it essentially “ties up all [her lifetime of] experiences.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma goes on to discuss her postgraduate scholarship in Greece where she interviewed close to thirty residents of Rhodes and Thessaloniki in Greek and Judeo-Spanish, investigating the area's Jewish history and Judeo-Spanish roots.  She details how she found her subjects, and the local community groups and residents who helped her with her research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her work began when she was awarded a scholarship for her trip to study abroad.  “Markos,” a man at a synagogue in Rhodes, helped her with her Greek and to become acclimated to Greece, Greek culture, and with making appointments to meet with Judeo-Spanish speakers.  Her first interviews was with two elderly Greek men in Rhodes, one who was a Holocaust survivor who explained that the large Jewish population in the area was part of a resettlement project for Jews to return to Rhodes and Thessaloniki (Salonica).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she travelled to Thessaloniki three weeks into her work, she learned of its history as one of the few historically Jewish majority cities in the world.

Emma discusses her childhood in the largely Jewish community of Chelmsford, Massachusetts where she gained a “comprehensive Jewish education” at Congregation Shalom.  She began her undergraduate in linguistics at eighteen at the University of Pennsylvania, and found the transition to be a “total culture shock.”  She “took many paths…to get involved with Judaism and Jewish identity” while at the University of Pennsylvania, including studying Judeo-Spanish under Beth Wagner and attending an off-campus Reconstructionist synagogue to be exposed to “a new kind of Judaism.”  Emma then describes how she sees language and linguistics being connected to Jewish identity.  She explains that “language is very connected to culture [and that] they can’t be extracted from one another.”  Her interest in studying linguistics is a reflection of her personal interest in culture, Judaism, and Hebrew, and that it essentially “ties up all [her lifetime of] experiences.” Emma goes on to discuss her postgraduate scholarship in Greece where she interviewed close to thirty residents of Rhodes and Thessaloniki in Greek and Judeo-Spanish, investigating the area's Jewish history and Judeo-Spanish roots.  She details how she found her subjects, and the local community groups and residents who helped her with her research.Her work began when she was awarded a scholarship for her trip to study abroad.  “Markos,” a man at a synagogue in Rhodes, helped her with her Greek and to become acclimated to Greece, Greek culture, and with making appointments to meet with Judeo-Spanish speakers.  Her first interviews was with two elderly Greek men in Rhodes, one who was a Holocaust survivor who explained that the large Jewish population in the area was part of a resettlement project for Jews to return to Rhodes and Thessaloniki (Salonica).  When she travelled to Thessaloniki three weeks into her work, she learned of its history as one of the few historically Jewish majority cities in the world.  After World War II, fifty to seventy thousand Jews, or ninety-six percent of the population was killed during the holocaust.  She worked with a local man “Marcel,” who was instrumental in screening twenty-five interviewees who were central and active in the Judeo-Spanish speaking community.  She then discussed the current population of eight hundred Jewish Salonicans, and the instrumental nature of the Jewish community of Thessaloniki that she described as meeting “with all my Jewish grandmothers and grandfathers all in one room.”  Her work with the Jewish community group was central to her research question and thesis, and she was “really happy to be able to record them… [it is] very important information for the world to have” but believes that Judeo-Spanish is dying out.Emma then discusses her current practice with Judeo-Spanish, and mentioned that she did not have many opportunities to practice.  She does occasionally correspond with her professor and her classmates, practices with her interview recordings, and participates in the online ListServ group “Ladinokomunita,” but wishes she “had more of a way to [practice Ladino].”Emma then discusses her experience as an intern with the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts, taking courses in Yiddish and Yiddish history and culture, and completing a practicum with the Wexler Oral History project where she conducted oral history interviews.  Over the course of her time in Amherst, she discovered many new aspects to linguistics through her approaches to Yiddish during this time, specifically that she once had “a superficial relationship with Yiddish” that has blossomed into a relationship of understanding and awareness – that she currently sees it as “most expressive language,” “the best language,” “the only language for expressing grief,” and a colorful language that contains a variety of words that express ideas available in no other language that are culturally embedded in the language itself.Emma finished the discussion expressing optimism, but uncertainty over the current secular popularity of the language, and is interested in seeing what Yiddish looks like to the next generation of speakers.

She also talked about her belief in G-d and how that relates to delivering babies.</teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2010-10-08</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>IleneGelbaum8oct2010YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/IleneGelbaum8oct2010YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Soviet UnionFamily history and stories re. ancestorsYiddish language (feelings of/about, meaning, descriptions of)Yiddish learningOther Jewish languagesPost-vernacular uses of YiddishComing back to YiddishJewish community (descriptions of place and social dynamics in a particular time)United StatesTravelEthnographyLatin AmericaReligion and ritualTransmission (intergenerational, cultural, social... parenting)RuralUrbanJewish holidays</themes><uncontroled_themes>Russian grandparents, New York, Russian, Yiddish, yiddish school teacher, jewish neighborhood, bubbes, grandmothers, grandparents, Hebrew and Yiddish, American Jewish vernacular, future generations losing Yiddishkeyt, meeting husband, Hebrew High School, elope, Jewish wedding, Sri Lanka, PeaceCorps, miracle rice, malaria clinic, midwife quarters, delivering neighbor's child, khanukah, chanukah, Jewish community in India, Dutch synagogue, Mount Sinai, new birth clinic, midwife, California, children, motherhood, bubbe, grandparenting, jewish heritage, geneology, grandchildren, Argentina, finding family, Rosita, Jewish matriarch, family photographs, multiculturalism, God, Iceland, traveling to Iceland to meet family she worked for as midwife, married life, finding a mate, when to have a baby, Judaism over lifetime, mohel</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Ilene Gelbaum</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Ilene</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Gelbaum</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1946</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Brooklyn, NY</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>145</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL9OGQqaUlM </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2292</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/story-rosita-finding-family-around-globe</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>146</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-kV9YCLeHA </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1642</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/returning-sri-lanka</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>147</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q13RqXBJFes</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>6108</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/peacecorps-sri-lanka-2</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>148</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-5lTTzOxYw</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>973</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/khanike-channukah-sri-lanka</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>149</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98eGtLnRWvY</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>970</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/high-holidays-a-synagogue-india</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>150</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA7s5VPCmBk</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>971</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/first-delivery-sri-lankan-village</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>151</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtk_L9ConUQ </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2293</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/he-was-activist-teacher-who-fought-yiddish</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>63</interview_id><interview_abstract>Christa Whitney, director of the Yiddish Book Center's Wexler Oral History Project, was interviewed by Lesley Yalen on October 12, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. </interview_abstract><teaser_text>Christa Whitney, director of the Yiddish Book Center's Wexler Oral History Project, was interviewed by Lesley Yalen on October 12, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. </teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center -

She remembers that her father liked to talk about his parents and grandparents, who were wealthy in Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution.  She knows that he came to America the first time alone at age 14 to look for his father, who had left the family to find work, and was planning to send back for them.  She remembers hearing how the two returned to Russia together, and then Leon graduated from Moscow University at a time when few Jews did such a thing.  One story she particularly remembered was her father’s experience in storming the Winter Palace as a member of the army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet recounts growing up in a family of five children in the Bronx, after her father and most of his family had immigrated to the United States in the 1920s.  She remembers there being large shoes to fill, especially since her older brother Gary became a world-renowned physicist.  She describes her childhood as a very happy one, though with its quirks.  She remembers having to keep quiet since her father slept during most of the day.  She remembers, too, her father’s odd habits like drinking tea from a glass with a cube of sugar in his teeth, or putting salt on watermelon before eating it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a Jewish neighborhood off the Grand Concourse in the Bronx (a sign at that time that they’d “made it”), Harriet recalls the neighbors looking up to the family.  She describes, too, feeling “different” because her family was so highly educated and culturally literate.  What she called the “intelligensia” used to visit her family’s home—writers and artists such as Itsik Manger, Chaim Grade, and Glatshteyn.  She distinguished her father’s love of family and pride in his many children as something that his contemporaries were envious of.  She recalls her father’s pride in “showing off” that she knew some Yiddish after her education in Workman’s Circle Yiddish shul.  She, too, felt proud that she might someday be able to read her father’s writings in the original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet described her mother as a “saint.”  Her life’s work was being a mother and wife, though Harriet remembers her father used to often take her out to “show her off,” as she was very beautiful.  Her father liked steak, others liked lamb chops or hamburgers, and her mother used to cook seven different meals according to the tastes of the different members of the family.  Harriet remembers that her mother was always willing to lend a listening ear to the neighbors, and reflects that her parents’ qualities complimented each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet describes her father as “dapper,” he wore spats, walked with a cane, and smoked Pall Malls from a cigarette holder.  It was assumed that every child would have piano lessons—something Harriet is now glad of since she is a big fan of classical music.  While religion was minimal in the home, the cultural aspects were paramount.  Politics, too, were present.  Her father, once a member of the communist party and writer for the Feyheyt communist newspaper, became disillusioned with the communist vision, and turned staunchly anti-communist.  He wrote outspoken articles against the party in his position as city editor of the newspaper Der Tog.  Harriet remembers that he corresponded with Boris Pasternak, whom her father strongly supported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet has fond memories of her summer camp experiences at Undzer Kamp, the family camp sponsored by the labor Zionist Farband.  She describes it as “truly a home away from home,” and remembers being depressed for several days after returning to her small city block after the six or seven weeks they spent at the camp every summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet remembers Kennedy’s assassination as a particularly intense moment in her life with her father.  She points out the Cuban Missile Crisis, too, as a moment when she turned to her father for comfort and fear of what might happen.  Harriet lived at home until the day she was married, and had a close relationship with both of her parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet reflects extensively on the values that were instilled in her by her parents, and how she tried to pass them on to her own children.  Memory of family, especially through storytelling, was of constant import in her family.  This value became important in her own role as a mother, as she tried to keep her husband’s memory very central after he died when her children were very young.  She felt that a core feeling towards Jewish culture and tradition runs through the family, even if there are varying levels of observance.  She accepts that children make their own decisions in life, but expressed pride in her son’s interest in beginning to celebrate some Khanuka traditions.  She remembers her family’s Yiddish Passover seder, and tells of how she infuses her Passover seders with Yiddishkeyt in her life today.  She feels very close to Yiddish, especially through the memory of her father, and tries to go to Yiddish performances whenever she can.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harriet was deeply moved by the Yiddish Book Center when she first visited in the summer of 2010.  She recalls feeling the sense that Yiddish really is not dead after seeing her father’s books on the shelves, and young students of the Steiner Summer Program leaving class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of all, Harriet’s father taught her to appreciate culture.  She remembers him as a vivid storyteller, one who brought history to life.  He was a participant in history, and she often remembers him now when she realizes that he experienced major events that are now displayed in museums or textbooks.  January 22nd, her father’s yortsayt (anniversary of his death) is always a melancholy day for Harriet, but she perhaps thinks of him the most on Khanuka.  She played dreydl with her kids, the way she did with her father, until they moved away from home.

He remembers how his father corresponded with his Aunt Rivke up until the 60s, when communication suddenly stopped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman’s father was 50 years old when he was born, and he recalls that they did not have the traditional father-son bond of sharing a love of sports.  He did, however, learn a lot from his father.  He recalls his home as a very academically-oriented one, where being an intellectual was the norm rather than a choice.  He recalls his father’s schedule—how he used to have to be quiet during the day since his father would sleep in the daytime after writing all night.  Norman fondly recalls a course on Yiddish literature on translation he took at a State University of New York, and the impact it had on him when he returned years later to find it blossomed into a full-fledged department.  Norman’s thesis on Sholem Ash had a surprising connection with his musical love, Bob Dylan, when he found out Dylan had played at a bistro owned by Sh. Ash’s son (Moses) in his early years in New York.  Norman recounts that, even amidst the criticism of Yiddish after the second world war, that his father said that Yiddish would never die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman recalls the many visitors that would come to the Friday night dinners that his mother prepared at their house.  While he was too young to remember many of the specific people that visited, he particularly remembers Genya Nada, widow of Yiddish writer Moyshe Nada, and lover of Itsik Manger.  Itsik Manger, the well-known Yiddish poet who suffered from alcoholism and depression, became a favorite of Norman’s after Manger once bought him a giant all-day sucker candy at Coney Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman calls his father a “renaissance man,” and especially admired his father’s talent and courage as a political journalist.  He specifically remembers when his father predicted a resolution during the Cuban Missle Crisis.  While the Feinberg family was not religious, they observed Passover.  Norman describes his father as a non-observant man who embodied the essential moral tenants of religion.  While his sisters went to Yiddish school, Norman insisted on going to Hebrew school with his friends.  While it was more due to his first love rather than the education that he stayed at Hebrew school, he did have bar mitzvah.  Norman remembers his father’s travels all over the world as one reason why they didn’t have much father-son bonding time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman reads one poem from his recent self-published book of 550 poems.  “A Promise Unfulfilled Yet Magical” relays a story of when Albert Einstein was impressed by an equation his brother Gary, then 6 years old, had written out and asked his father to pass along when Leon went to a dinner honoring the eminent scientist.  Norman describes his brother Gary as his surrogate father.  Gary, a child prodigy, skipped straight to 3rd grade, and became the youngest full professor of Theoretical Physics in the history of Columbia University.  Norman tells a story (one of his family favorites) of two elderly ladies’ reactions upon seeing Gary, then age 2 and a half, reading the New York Times on the subway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman tells stories from a list of notes he had prepared prior to the interview.  He tells of how his father was from the same town as painter Marc Chagall and actor Paul Muni.  It was a joke with Leon’s wife that if he had only accepted Chagall’s offer of a painting, they would have been financially set for life.  He recounts the one time he ever saw his father frightened—the family became the unintended brunt of a practical joke Gary’s friend played when Leon opened a telegram reading “your son is dead.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman remembers his father accompanying him to the hospital after a wrist injury on his 21st birthday as a rare moment of connection between the two of them.  Norman concludes with a touching reflection on his inheritance of his father’s love of writing: “I am my father’s son.”&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Norman Feinberg - retired college professor of music at Mercy College and youngest son of the late Leon Feinberg, Yiddish poet, author of many books, and regional editor for the Yiddish paper Der Tog - was interviewed by Christa Whitney on October 28, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Norman recounts how his father came to the United States, first at age 14, alone, to follow his father, and the second time after graduating from Moscow University, once the family had become disillusioned with Communism.

Norman concludes with a touching reflection on his inheritance of his father’s love of writing: “I am my father’s son.”</teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Beyond the Books: Yiddish writers and their descendants</interview_interview_series><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2010-10-28</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><beyond_the_books_author>Leon Feinberg,</beyond_the_books_author><beyond_the_books_author_loc>Feinberg, Leon, 1897-1969</beyond_the_books_author_loc><ia_identifier>NormanFeinberg28october2010YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/NormanFeinberg28october2010YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><other_derivation_url>512kb MPEG4: https://archive.org/download/NormanFeinberg28october2010YiddishBookCenter/NormanSequence-edited_512kb.mp4</other_derivation_url><themes>Yiddish Book CenterChildhoodFamily history and stories re. ancestorsJewish IdentityYiddish language (feelings of/about, meaning, descriptions of)Immigration, Migration, and placeLiteratureRadioPressEducationReligion and ritualEastern EuropeSoviet UnionUnited StatesCanadaPolitics and political movementsJewish community (descriptions of place and social dynamics in a particular time)children/grandchildren of (Yiddish personalities)UrbanShtetl</themes><uncontroled_themes>Wexler Oral History Project; Russia; New York City; Marc Chagall; Albert Einstein; Maurice Schwartz; Itzik Manger; Sholem Ash; Der Tog; Freiheit</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Norman Feinberg</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Norman</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Feinberg</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1947</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Bronx, NY</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>109</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RVcX7w2ZU </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1846</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/coney-island-with-itzik-manger</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>110</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_uh5w_vLtQ </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1849</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/you-dont-have-be-practicing-jew-be-religious</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>111</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>112</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>113</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3gLi9H-F_g </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1848</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/my-fathers-break-with-bashevis</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>114</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijoTVlZ_FsE </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1847</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/my-father-refused-a-chagall-painting</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>115</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>116</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNbNEyrFxxE</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5498</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/yiddish-will-never-die-1</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>117</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2svSwT4FScQ </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1855</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/norman-reads-his-poem-a-promise-unfulfilled-yet-magical-0</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>118</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>71</interview_id><interview_abstract>Lili Bermant, 83-year-old widow from Antwerp, Belgium currently living in Amherst, Massachusetts, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on October 26, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili started the interview talking about her upbringing in Belgium before the outbreak of World War II. Both of her parents were Jewish, her mother from a religious family in Poland. Her mother, wanting to get a better education, came to Belgium from Poland. She spoke German and French. Lili’s father spoke Flemish and Yiddish, but as Lili said, somehow they made it work. Lili’s father was a diamond broker in Antwerp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Nazi occupation of Belgium brought on a series of attempted and realized escapes to other parts of Europe and eventually the United States. When Lili’s parents felt it was dangerous, the whole family (including Lili’s grandfather), traveled to a series of three towns on the border of France and Belgium in order to seek refuge. They eventually crossed the border into France and spent several days walking across the countryside, trying to avoid the invading German troops. Lili talked about what it was like to walk with all of their belongings and to stay in cramped French farmhouses during their journey. The family had to turn around, however, when they encountered a family coming from the opposite direction that was doing just the same: trying to escape invading German troops. At that point, Lili’s family returned to the border towns and were eventually told they had to go back to Antwerp, where they had come from. Luckily, their landlady had made the apartment look lived-in so that German troops passed over it as they attempted to find quarters within the city. The apartment still intact, Lili and her family stayed there until again, they felt it was too dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before their second escape, Lili’s father secured false papers somehow. Lili often mentioned, during the interview, that she had no idea how her parents were able to work the system in order to buy papers or secure passage to wherever they needed to go. This time, the family intended to travel from Antwerp to Brussels to Paris to some part of France that was unoccupied. Lili’s grandfather decided he did not want to come; instead, he somehow stayed with a non-Jewish family during the war and survived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili told the story of their train from Brussels to Paris, on an express Berlin to Paris train. The train was too crowded and the family got stuck in the middle of the car, with no compartment. It was very cold, so Lili’s mother asked three Germans in a compartment if the family could squeeze in with them. Lili’s mother, educated in German and a sharp woman, spoke with the German officer about how he was sad to be leaving his family back in Germany to go to Paris. At one point, border control entered the train and demanded the family’s papers; the falsified ones didn’t satisfy the officer, so he demanded a passport. As Lili’s father pretended to look for it, the German officer they shared the compartment with waved away the younger border control officer. As Lili said, her family was saved by a German officer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The family spent a couple of weeks in Paris and then moved on to Nice, the French Riviera, as Lili says. She enjoyed her time there, and life wasn’t too hard. But the family wanted to get to the United States, so they again picked up (after nine months or so) and went to Spain. Lili’s mother somehow met a man who was able to secure better accommodations for them on a boat from Bilbao, Spain, to Havana, Cuba. Lili talked about crossing the Atlantic: the Mexican youngsters who taught her sister some Spanish, eating in first class on the boat, and the boat nearly sinking during a hurricane near the Bahamas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the family arrived in Havana, Lili’s uncle met them, but they were still sent off to a detention camp for a couple of weeks. They eventually were released and stayed in Cuba for four years. Lili completed high school there and her sister worked; the family moved to the United States in 1945, after the war ended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked about Jewish identity, Lili talked about her struggles with being Jewish as a child. She did not like visiting her mother’s family because they were still very religious and she felt uncomfortable. She, in some sense, associated being Jewish with limitations and extra responsibility: not being able to attend public school on Saturdays, being required to attend extra Hebrew school, even though she didn’t get anything out of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili joined the youth group Shomer Hadati in Havana, which was a religious Zionist organization. She enjoyed the social aspect of it, even if it meant becoming more religious – keeping shabbes and such. She fondly remembers reading Yiddish stories and going camping on Friday nights with the youth group. However, she was unable to dance socially because the group was too religious, which was a significant restriction given that she lived in Cuba. At some point, she dropped out of the youth group, which was not a problem since the family moved from Cuba shortly after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili married a Jewish American man, but talked a little bit about her parents’ negative feelings regarding dating non-Jews and dating Americans (rather than Europeans). Lili and her husband ended up moving out of New York City (where they had lived) and raising their family in parts of upstate New York: Poughkeepsie and Woodstock. There were small Jewish communities there, but Lili became disenchanted when a smart, progressive rabbi was let go because he didn’t fit the aura of the Jewish community. This furthered some of her already-held views about Judaism being hypocritical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili and her mother had a significant argument about whether or not Lili’s son would become a bar mitzvah. Lili and her husband decided it was not important—her husband had done it, but it meant very little to him. Lili’s mother threatened to never step foot in the house again, but in the end she came to respect their decision.&lt;br&gt;Lili’s mother became a diamond broker when her husband died shortly after they arrived in America. She was a diamond broker until she was 81, and then she took a creative writing class. She wrote stories that Lili collected into a few volumes. This was the conclusion of our interview.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Lili Bermant, 83-year-old widow from Antwerp, Belgium currently living in Amherst, Massachusetts, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on October 26, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Lili started the interview talking about her upbringing in Belgium before the outbreak of World War II.

His paternal background came from Austro-Hungarian Galicia at the turn of the twentieth century, and his maternal grandparents from Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century.  Both his parents were born and later lived in the New York area.  Joel grew up in the Bronx and then Mt. Vernon in southern Westchester.  He remembers Yiddish being spoken in the home between his parents when they didn’t want him to understand.  His Irish nanny, who took care of him while both of his parents were working, taught him some Gaelic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel’s father managed a factory that made instrument panels for cars and appliances.  Joel remembers visiting the factory as the “son of one of the bosses.”  Later he published several articles that derived from the lengthy autobiography his father wrote.  Part of these published memoirs dealt with family life.  In his childhood, he had two play groups: one all-Jewish and one all-Christian (in which he was the only one of Jewish background).  He remembers an anti-Semitic slur a playmate made to him after Joel tackled him in football.  Joel marked several aspects of his childhood—his father’s job, their neighborhood, swimming lessons, horseback riding, his Irish nanny, driving to Manhattan in a company car.  His mother, who was a school teacher, had access to the company car as needed on weekends, especially Saturdays.  The family was not very observant, and Joel’s father worked on Saturday, albeit a somewhat shorter day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel’s parents attended synagogue on the High Holidays, celebrated Hannukah, and the family would go to Passover seders at his paternal grandparents’ home and also regularly visited them with his parents on Friday nights.  Joel reverbs his grandmother as not being very observant and learned that this was the case with her father as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel went to Hebrew school for several years and had a Bar Mitzvah.  The family also had a Christmas tree and opened presents on Christmas morning for several years, a tradition Joel links to his fathers Christian co-workers.  The practice of having a tree was abandoned with the rise of news about Hitler in the late thirties, but presents were still a part of Christmas morning.  His father undertook an annual task of sending hundreds of Christmas cards (non-religious in nature) to his business associates – Joel is unclear why his father did this at home and why it was not an office function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel became interested first in Chemistry (per influence of his father’s work), and then in Anthropology and Archeology while an undergraduate at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  He switched from being a Chemistry major to an Anthropology major and with that any thought of joining his father’s business.  One of his first field work trips was to northern Alaska in 1950, during the McCarthy era.  Once there, he was subsequently sent off to do independent research in another settlement because his Jewishness had made his professors “uncomfortable.”  Ironically, the grad student who tipped him off that he was going to be made to leave also encouraged him to join the Communist Party.  In the second settlement, he befriended a recently-arrived Irish priest with his few words of Gaelic.  They became friends and he stayed at a house owned by a “Jewish Eskimo.”  She was the daughter of a Jewish man who had been a storekeeper in the village.  But the daughter was a loyal Catholic convert and, in turn, sent her daughter to parochial school in Seattle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in his career, Joel did work in a Croatian village Lekenik that would be used as the set for the Hollywood movie version of Fiddler on the Roof.  Joel explains that this was because at the height of the Cold War in 1964 the film could not be filmed in the more-authentic Ukraine (or even in Poland).  Joel pointed out the irony that not one of the village’s small but important pre-WWII Jewish community survived the Holocaust, nor were they mentioned once in his time initially researching there in 1961-62.  Joel and his former wife conducted long-term research in a Serbian village, Orasac.  (This same town was used as a site for Muslim refugees from Bosnia in the early 1990s when they were fleeing the civil war.)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel and his former wife conducted long-term research in a Serbian village, Orasac.  They discovered that their host family had sheltered a Jewish family during the Second World War.  Hoping to promote their survival, the peasant host family attempted to eradicate all traces of their former middle-class life in Zagreb by “turning them into peasants,” a process which included pulling out their gold teeth and irritating the skin of their hands to look like those of manual laborers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel has seen much change in the field of anthropology over his career.  He explained that he has been doing research into his Jewish heritage in recent years.  He has participated in several academic conferences on Jewish topics, and was an adjunct professor in the Judaic and Near Eastern Studies department at UMass Amherst for a time.  He has taught classes on the socio-cultural life of Eastern Europe and the United States.  He is pleased the Yiddish Book Center is reaching out and making itself “relevant” for the future by conducting oral history interviews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Joel Halpern, professor emeritus of Anthropology at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on March 4, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Joel focused on his childhood and Jewish stories from his career and anthropological field work.

(Only about 50-70,000 Jews survived on Polish soil.) His parents were both from Warsaw; his mother went to the University of Warsaw and taught history before she went into hiding. His father was in the Warsaw Ghetto through the great deportation, and then went underground. His parents met in liberated Lublin in August 1944 where his father was a founder of the first committee of Jewish survivors on Polish soil. Both had been married before, but after the war they married and went to an Italian displaced persons camp before moving to Paris. Professor Steinlauf was born there and then the family moved to Brighton Beach in New York City when Professor Steinlauf was three years old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professo Steinlaufâs mother spoke no Yiddish, but his father spoke both Yiddish and Polish. They spoke Polish in the home. Professor Steinlauf remembers Brighton Beach being a Yiddish-speaking, mostly elderly community, with some refugees and their children mixed in. The family did not go to shul (synagogue) except on Yom Kippur; he remembered seeing the Club 21 convert into a shul on that holiday. He went to Hebrew school, which he calls a âtrivial experience.â The home was Jewish simply because his parents were modern Polish-speaking Jews; he emphasized that the Polish part of that identity was important. In fact, he also connected this identity growing up with the time most recently when he found his grandfathersâ tombstones at the major Jewish cemetery in Warsaw. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of Professor Steinlaufâs parentsâ friends were like them: they survived in hiding, lived in Brighton Beach, and had one or two children. These friends used to come over to play Polish card games and rehash war stories; only one friend, Yasha, wouldnât talk because he had survived Auschwitz. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Steinlauf left Brighton Beach at 16 to attend Columbia University. He could not wait to leave Brighton Beach because he felt it was too confining. He wanted to be American and was embarrassed by his parents when they wouldnât speak English in public. The tough Jewish kids also beat him up a lot, another reason he wanted to leave. He had already left, in some sense; he attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. Professor Steinlauf remembered, when he was at Columbia, it suddenly dawned on him that the word he was hearing, âHolocaust,â was the same as the word wojna (voyna), which meant war, that his parents and their friends always talked about&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every weekend, Professor Steinlauf came home from Columbia to Brighton Beach. But soon he was swept up in the 1960sââThat was my world.â He was involved in the sit-in at Columbia and helped take over buildings. He remembered when Tom Hayden was elected chairman of Math Hall, as well as the arrival of an armed group who called themselves the Motherfuckers of the Lower East Side. The police clubbed students and arrested a thousand of them in one night, including Professor Steinlauf. Now that he knows how many Jews were involved, he thinks of all this as an unconscious way of saying "Never again". Professor Steinlauf mentioned that he did drugs at Columbia as well. He was also involved in a hunger strike and he remembered his parents showing up during it; he told them he was okay so he could get them to leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Steinlauf earned good grades to get his BA in English at Columbia, and went on to do his Masters in American Literature at the same institution. He felt as if he was being groomed to be an English professor, and early on found a job at Rutgers in Newark. But he found the job intolerable and walked out of the classroom on the first day. He felt there was nothing else to do but make a revolution, so he headed out west, starting in Seattle. Living with a woman there, Professor Steinlauf got involved in radical politics and had friends who founded what some would consider a terrorist group. One of these friends got killed robbing a bank, which spurred Professor Steinlauf to turn away from violence. In Seattle, he was the editor of No Separate Peace, the publication of a community organizing coalition. Professor Steinlauf talked about the mix of Chicanos, Filipinos, Chinese, Native Americans, African Americans and Jews involved in this organization. The Jews had a very specific role, he said: to write the leaflets. Yet he began to see a Jewish diaspora identity parallel to these American minority identities.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Steinlauf then moved to Boston, and continued to develop a notion of his own identity as part of a Polish Jewish nation decimated in the Holocaust. He began reading about the Holocaust and then started to study Yiddish. He attended the YIVO program in 1978, where he remembers clashing with a Yiddish teacher over the issue of the Jewish people being alive or dead. He argued that Jews were alive and well, in fact speaking Yiddish still, while the teacher said matter-of-factly, âDos yidishe folk iz nishto.â (The Jewish people are no longer.)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there, Professor Steinlauf went to Poland for a year on a Fulbright Scholarship and made friends with people in the Solidarity movement there. One of Professor Steinlaufâs criticisms of many Yiddishists is that they donât actually go to Eastern Europe to understand the milieu or the physical place of Yiddish. He remembered how the two greatest figures for Polish people at the time were Ronald Reagan and the pope â something not exactly in line with his worldview! Professor Steinlauf enjoys teaching non-Jews and heâs found that teaching allows him to re-discover his own excitement about various topics.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Steinlaufâs academic work has revolved around Polish-Jewish relations and Jewish life in Poland before the Holocaust. He also has studied Peretz, who Professor Steinlauf views as an important Jewish diaspora nationalist figure. Yiddish has figured into his academic work because it allows him to access a world thatâs gone. He says he loves Yiddish, and is able to read it well. Professor Steinlauf emphasized his strong links to the âplaceâ that is Poland, and also discussed the interplay between shtetl and urban culture in prewar Poland the a source of a national culture that aspired to modernity.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Jewish Cultural Festival in Krakow, which Professor Steinlauf has participated in, is symbolic of the importance he sees in moving beyond academia to reclaim Jewish culture as oneâs own. Academia is one avenue of learning culture, and itâs better than nothing, but there are other ways, too. In this same vein, cultural dislocations are not a new phenomenon, according to Professor Steinlauf, and sometimes people view culture as a burden even though a Jew in the diaspora does not always have to be a Jew. Professor Steinlauf does not consider himself a Yiddishist, but rather someone who uses Yiddish to open up the past.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although he is uncertain of the future of Yiddish, Professor Steinlauf pointed out that the situation of Yiddish is far superior to that of Hebrew one hundred years ago! The situation has improved recently. He encouraged students of Yiddish to keep at it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Steinlauf mentioned two dichotomies that exist in Yiddish/Jewish contemporary culture: secular and Haredi Yiddish speakers; and Israel vs. Eastern Europe as formational forces in Jewish identity in the modern world.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Michael Steinlauf, associate professor of History at Gratz College, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on December 19, 2010 at the Association for Jewish Studies Conference in Boston, Massachusetts. Professor Steinlauf is the only child of Polish Holocaust survivors who survived, in hiding, on Polish soil.

Katz, an 84-year old Yiddishist born in Hartford, Connecticut, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on November 29, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An 84-year-old native of Hartford, Connecticut, Elaine was raised in a secular Jewish home with Yiddish-speaking parents. Her father was from Eastern Europe, from a religious family, but he broke from their example and announced his secular Jewish identity. He was a builder. Her mother was from Egypt and attended the French and Jewish Alliance Israelite Universelle schools there. She worked in fashion retail when she was in Egypt, and when she came to the United States, the family meeting her at the port had brought clothes because they did not want her to wear immigrant-style clothing. Little did they know that Elaine’s mother would be wearing all the latest fashions of Paris!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaine said she felt like the only secular Jewish girl in Hartford, Connecticut when she was growing up. She had the opportunity to go to Camp Wochica (Workers’ Children’s Camp) as a counselor. She said that experience really broadened her horizons, allowing her to meet all kinds of young and interesting people. She loved going for the three summers she worked there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaine went away to college at Ohio State University to study social work. She liked it very much, and said that she went the furthest from home that her parents would allow. She met her husband at Ohio State; he was in the army, stationed at (or near) the university. She had trouble dating; because of her rheumatic fever as a child, she hadn’t interacted much with people her own age and thus became very nervous upon meeting new people. Just when her friends had given up on trying to set her up with someone, she met her husband in the Hillel House. She was bored that day, so decided to go over to Hillel; she didn’t think anyone was actually in the building, until she heard a record playing of Jewish partisan music from Europe. She found three soldiers playing the record, and when she talked to her future husband, Lyber, she realized she knew both his cousin and his father, the writer Moishe Katz. Moishe Katz visited Hartford to give lectures and he would stay at Elaine’s house. Elaine and Lyber dated for a few weeks, until school vacation started; during vacation, Lyber was shipped out. They kept in sporadic contact over the next few years, until Lyber came back from the war and looked Elaine up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaine moved to New York after college and has lived there ever since. Elaine and her husband were involved in the Jewish Young Fraternalists, which was part of the Jewish People’s Fraternal Order. It was basically the youth movement that was involved in offering courses and musical performances: all kinds of social and political events. Elaine remembered the musical director, Bob Decormier, who was not Jewish but a stickler for making music as authentic as possible. One time, Bob was trying to teach someone the name of a song he was to announce at a performance, and the person could not say “shvet” correctly. Music is important in Elaine’s life, but she insisted, like she did about many other parts of her life, that this was just what people did. She likes music relating to workers’ struggles, fitting in with the way she was brought up and her other political/social affiliations.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Elaine was involved in a shule, a once-a-week school in Yiddish language and history, near her apartment in New York. Her children attended the school and she eventually led it for eleven years. She said the shule only had about ten children at any given time, with one or two teachers. The aim was to make the children feel comfortable speaking Yiddish and to understand where they came from/what their roots were. There was some difference in opinion between the teachers, who wanted to correct the children’s Yiddish mistakes, and the shule’s mission of keeping the children comfortable in the language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaine and her husband have traveled around the world, to countries including China, New Zealand, Australia, Tunisia, parts of southern Africa, and parts of Europe.  They tried to find the Jewish sites and Holocaust museums wherever they traveled, and she said some of them were very unusual, varying in their attitudes about the Jewish past and future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaine currently participates in a Yiddish shmooze group, which involved Bella Gottesman (a famous Yiddish poet). She became involved when her daughter-in-law informed her that she would be raising their children in Yiddish. Elaine says her Yiddish has improved immensely since joining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaine advised future generations to simply live and not make such a fuss about every single thing they are doing. She wants future generations to live for their own children and the generations of their futures.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Elaine Katz, an 84-year old Yiddishist born in Hartford, Connecticut, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on November 29, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. An 84-year-old native of Hartford, Connecticut, Elaine was raised in a secular Jewish home with Yiddish-speaking parents.

Baumgarten, scholar of Medieval Yiddish and Director of Research at Centre de Recherches Historiques in Paris, France, was interviewed by David Schlitt on December 21, 2010 at the Association for Jewish Studies Conference in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Baumgarten’s family traces its origins back to the Alsace region; he comes from a family of horse dealers and leather merchants. His family came to Paris in the 19th Century. He grew up in what he described as an assimilated family. He was not involved in a specific Jewish community or synagogue, and he did not speak Yiddish growing up. He recalled that the Holocaust and war were only rarely discussed when we was growing up, but after the Six-Day War, people began to assert themselves Jewishly more. Indeed, that is the period at which Professor Baumgarten began to get involved in the Jewish community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Baumgarten described traveling to Eastern Europe in the late-1960s and early-1970s, and traveling to Israel in 1970. He began to study Yiddish with Professor Alexander Jansky [sp?], read Weinreich’s History of the Yiddish Language, studied at Oxford University, where he was inspired by the holdings of the Bodleian Library. His first major Yiddish-related academic project was his translation of the tsene rene into French – a formative experience. This was in the late-1970s/early-1980s; he worked on the project with Alexander Jansky. Professor Baumgarten was interested not just in the tsene rene’s contents but also the in way the text was diffused throughout Europe. He described his work with Early Yiddish as a method of conducting social history through texts.

Raised in Staten Island, in a Jewish, but not particularly religious, environment, Kalman heard Yiddish as a child, and knew that it was in some way tied to the identity of preceding generations, but not more than that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then talks about his time as an undergraduate at Yale, where he discovered a local Yiddish reading circle that opened his eyes to the richness of Yiddish culture and modern Jewish history. He goes on to discuss his decision to continue his studies in the Yiddish graduate program at Columbia. Here he found a close-knit group of scholars and fellow students, and made organic connections with the living Yiddish culture of New York at that time. These experiences were particularly formative in shaping the early and middle phases of his personal Yiddishist philosophy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Weiser proceeds to reflect on his journey to York University, where he currently teaches. He contrasts his teaching experiences in Toronto to those at Columbia and in the Weinreich summer program, suggesting that these map onto to larger differences in American and Canadian Jewish cultures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He turns next to his main academic interests - the intellectuals Noah Prilutski, the subject of his first book, and Max Weinreich, whose papers he pored over for a year while at the University of Michigan. Both projects have been part of his attempt to understand the contours of Yiddishism and the institutions it spawned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A broader discussion of the value of Yiddish to the study of modern Jewish history follows, as Professor Weiser laments that many continue to look down upon Yiddish, and that the language remains on the periphery of modern Jewish identities. This leads to a more personal exploration of his current Yiddishism, and his assessment of how feasible or desirable it is to speak and live in Yiddish within and without Toronto. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After briefly surveying the sectors of the contemporary Yiddish world, Professor Weiser examines the role of the academy in bringing Yiddish back in from the periphery. He then discusses his upcoming projects and goals, which center on training a new generation of researchers within the still-developing programs that York has to offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Weiser concludes by returning to what Yiddish means to him today, asserting that it remains an intimate part of him even if the viability of living in Yiddish, speaking it on a regular basis, or raising a family in Yiddish may be in doubt. He suggests that his scholarship has allowed him to think about the questions of Jewish identity and peoplehood in both broad and personal terms.

Isaacs, linguist and professor of Yiddish, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on December 26, 2010 at KlezKamp in the Catskills Mountains of New York State.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Isaacs begins the interview discussing her family background. Her mother was from the shtetl (village) Solotvina, near Siget, Czechoslovakia which is today a part of Ukraine. Her father was from Isterik (in Yiddish), or Ustrzyki Dolne in Polish, in Galicia, Poland.  Professor Isaacs explains that she was born in a Displaced Persons camp in Leipheim, Germany.  Her family immigrated to Montreal, Canada when she was two years old.  She shares many pleasant memories of life in Montreal, the beauty of the city, the freedom she enjoyed because the city felt safe, the rich mix of cultures, and the Yiddish cultural institutions. She then moves on to talk about her family’s move to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York when she was twelve years old.  She contrasts her education in Montreal, which she considered very fine, with the poor and chaotic Brooklyn public school where she was enrolled in middle school.  Her academic prospects improved when she went to Erasmus High School.  She recounts the conflicts in her family over her future, her mother proposing to marry her off to a Hasid when she was a teenager, her father objecting to the match but doubtful about how useful college could be for a girl.  Dr. Isaacs laughs as she tells how she prevailed and studied at Brooklyn College, how fortunate she was that the City University of New York had free tuition because her family could not have afforded to send her to college. She went on to get a PhD from Cornell University in linguistics, and describes her father's transformed feelings, first thinking that too much education might spoil her chances to marry, but later boasting about his daughter's doctoral degree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Isaacs explains that she always spoke Yiddish with her parents, but never studied it formally although her father had taught her to read.  When she was studying linguistics at Cornell, she describes how she began to examine and study Yiddish.  Her fellow student used her way of speaking Yiddish as the basis of research he was doing, and she became conscious of how she spoke.  Students at the campus Hillel wanted to learn Yiddish, she volunteered to teach, and therefore she learned as she taught the grammar, using the Weinreich College Yiddish. She laughs as she tells an anecdote of a linguist friend recalling her strong Galitzyaner (Galician) accent as she attempted to teach Standard Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After graduate school, working as a lobbyist in Albany, New York and Washington, DC, Dr. Isaacs talks about finding her way back to teaching. She describes her experience teaching ESL as “very rewarding” and also discusses her time at the University of Maryland, where she lectured on her research into Yiddish among the Haredi in Israel. She taught Yiddish language for sixteen years, varying her teaching techniques to suit the changing student body. She explains that she believes that to teach language is to teach culture. For her, Yiddish is embedded in mentshlekhkeyt (humanity), and the emotion and cadence of a particular culture that cannot fully be grasped in translation. She then reflects on her teaching experiences, comparing the experience of teaching Yiddish in summer programs in Prague, Czech Republic and in Vilnius, Lithuania, where she found rich, immersive experiences with interesting fellow teachers and students.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of the interview, Dr. Isaacs shares a final anecdote about meeting the Yiddish poet Avrom Sutzkever at a conference in Oxford, England in 1983. She recalls that when Sutzkever heard her speaking her dialect of Yiddish, he expressed pleasure at hearing real Yiddish, not Yiddish “from a book.”  That convinced Dr. Isaacs that she could aspire to teach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Miriam Isaacs, linguist and professor of Yiddish, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on December 26, 2010 at KlezKamp in the Catskills Mountains of New York State.Dr. Isaacs begins the interview discussing her family background.

She recalls that when Sutzkever heard her speaking her dialect of Yiddish, he expressed pleasure at hearing real Yiddish, not Yiddish “from a book.”  That convinced Dr. Isaacs that she could aspire to teach. </teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish in the Academy: scholars, language instructors, and students</interview_interview_series><interview_location>KlezKamp in the Catskills Mountains, NY</interview_location><interview_date>2010-12-26</interview_date><interview_language>Yiddish</interview_language><ia_identifier>MiriamIsaacs26december2010YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/MiriamIsaacs26december2010YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Yiddish language,Family history, stories about ancestors,Childhood,Eastern Europe,Canada,United States,Food and culinary traditions,Education,Yiddish teaching,Career and Professional Life,song, singing,Music,Advice,Yiddish revival and activism,Immigration, Migration,Transmission,Holocaust,Scholarship, Academia,Israel,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Miriam Isaacs, KlezKamp, Sutzkever, Galicia, Brooklyn, New York City, NYC, Montreal, Prague, Vilna, Vilnius, Vilne, French,</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Miriam Isaacs</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Miriam</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Isaacs</narrator_last_name><narrator_place_of_birth>Montreal Quebec, Canada</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>140</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjfi0ULSXs0 </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>1230</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/at-home-yiddish-school-english-streets-french</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1063</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1064</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1065</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1066</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1067</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1068</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1069</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1070</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1071</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1672</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1673</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1674</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1675</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>93</interview_id><interview_abstract>Paula Teitelbaum, a Yiddishist and Yiddish language teacher, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on Dec. 28, 2010 at KlezKamp in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paula was born and raised in post-war Poland.

Her mother was a Yiddish and Hebrew singer, and she says that Yiddish was in her ear from the time she was born. &lt;br&gt;Adrienne grew up in Oakland, California. She describes her family as “not frum,” although they kept kosher at home, and observed Shabbat. They belonged first to an Orthodox and then to a Conservative shul. She credits the synagogues as the source of her Jewish literacy and says she spent “five days a week in shul studying,” although she also attended public schools throughout her childhood. She had friends in school, but her best friends were in Young Judea, a peer-led Zionist youth group through which she learned about socialism and Zionism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrienne spent two years at the University of California, Berkeley, and then moved to Israel, where she studied History and English Literature at Hebrew University. After finishing her degree, she returned to the United States and pursued a Ph.D in History at the University of Chicago. During that time, she attended the Yiddish summer program at the YIVO Institute in New York. She says she had “no idea why she started with Yiddish,” but the language attracted her. After her summer at YIVO, Adrienne was offered a fellowship there, became Assistant Director of YIVO’s Max Weinreich Center for Advanced Jewish Studies, and went on to direct the YIVO summer program. &lt;br&gt;The six-week summer program comprised three hours of language learning each morning and Yiddish cultural activities each afternoon, five days a week. Adrienne, observing that many people couldn’t devote so much time to learning a language, wondered if the structure could be changed to emphasize cultural immersion, with a smaller language component. In 1985, Adrienne and Henry Sapoznik co-founded such a program: KlezKamp, an annual, week-long immersion in Klezmer music and Yiddish culture. Adrienne says that KlezKamp emerged from a desire to make Yiddish accessible to a larger and more diverse group of people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrienne discusses passing Yiddish on to her daughter, Yiddish singer and lyricist Sarah Gordon. Adrienne sang to her in Yiddish from the time she was born, and taught her some vocabulary, trying to reproduce her own experience of hearing Yiddish throughout her childhood. Yiddish was not regularly spoken in their home, but Adrienne says Sarah absorbed the culture by “osmosis”: many of her babysitters were YIVO students, and she spent every winter holiday at KlezKamp. Adrienne describes a photograph of four-year-old Sarah sitting at Max Weinreich’s desk, talking into the phone. When Sarah was 12 years old, she and Adrienne worked together on a CD about remembering the children of the Holocaust, continuing the family tradition of music.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;	Adrienne says she is attracted to Yiddish because it provides an opportunity to connect to living, participatory Jewish culture. She describes her love for the golesdikayt – the off-balance, exiled quality – of Yiddish culture. She says that because Yiddish is not “culturally dominant,” it needs our energy, our desire, and our participation. Adrienne reminds us that Yiddish belongs to us, and we have every right and also every responsibility to it. She asks us to be bold and fearless in order to explore and create in Yiddish, so that our culture persists.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Adrienne Cooper, world-renowned Yiddish singer and educator, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on December 28, 2010 at KlezKamp, in the Catskills of New York State.  In her interview, Adrienne talks about coming from a long line of singers.

Wex, novelist, translator, and scholar of Yiddish language and literature, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on December 29, 2010 at KlezKamp, in the Catskills of New York State. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Wex’s interview takes us through a beautifully detailed and often funny telling of his life growing up in Canada, his time spent studying medieval literature, and how his interests eventually led him to write “Born to Kvetch.”  The interview begins with Michael’s detailed family history that he dates back to his grandfather’s grandfather, a famous Hasidic rebbe in Poland.  He then describes his family’s relocation to Canada in the 1920s and 30s, before moving on towards descriptions of his parents.&lt;br&gt;Michael grew up in Lethbridge, a small town in southern Alberta, Canada.  Michael describes his childhood growing up in a home where Yiddish was the primary language.   He paints a portrait of his small town, before moving on to his descriptions of Calgary and Toronto—the two cities his family moved to in his youth.  Michael describes the Jewish communities in all of these areas, touching upon the Canadian Jewish population before and after World War II, Jewish day schools, and religious observances.  Although Michael explains how he grew up in a Jewish home, his stories come alive when he describes his experiences listening to his grandfather and his friends talk about life in Poland; and, retrospectively perhaps, he sees these moments as critical to his Yiddish language and culture acquisition.&lt;br&gt;The latter half of the interview goes over Michael’s life in college and graduate school.  Michael presents a riveting story of how he started studying medieval literature, and how that path eventually led him back to Yiddish language writing.  This section of the interview is filled with stories, both humorous and serious, that track Michael’s changing thought process throughout his young adulthood.  He comments on his interest in klezmer and his involvement in KlezKamp, and it is through this story that he eventually describes the events that led to his book “Born to Kvetch”.&lt;br&gt;The interview ends with Michael thinking through questions of Yiddish language use.  But more interestingly, Michael ends his interview describing the importance of Yiddish for Jewish life and its cultural consciousness.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Michael, Wex, novelist, translator, and scholar of Yiddish language and literature, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on December 29, 2010 at KlezKamp, in the Catskills of New York State. Michael Wex’s interview takes us through a beautifully detailed and often funny telling of his life growing up in Canada, his time spent studying medieval literature, and how his interests eventually led him to write “Born to Kvetch.”  The interview begins with Michael’s detailed family history that he dates back to his grandfather’s grandfather, a famous Hasidic rebbe in Poland.

Benjy details how his paternal grandparents were from Poland, his grandfather from Lvov and his grandmother from Krakow; and, how his maternal grandparents were from Germany, his grandfather from Vienna and his grandmother from Dormant.  The geographical details, however, only brush the surface of the stories Benjy shares about his grandparents and his parents, which includes migrations from Europe to Israel to New York and California.  In fact, Benjy’s grandmother, Sara Rose, wrote a book that explains much of what Benjy covers called “My Lost World.”&lt;br&gt;Benjy goes on to describe his life growing up Los Angeles in a conservative home.  He went to Solomon Schechter elementary school and Milken Community High School.  He spends time describing both his father and mother’s lives before children, proudly sharing how his mother was one of the first female rabbis in the world.  Benjy describes the smattering of languages he heard growing up:  Polish from one set of grandparents, German from another, Hebrew from his parents, and the occasional bit of Yiddish.  Benjy also recounts his summers at Camp Alonim, an unaffiliated institute that cultured a labor Zionist environment for camp goers.&lt;br&gt;Benjy then moves on to describe his evolution as a musician.  Beginning with his first attempts at the piano, Benjy careful traces his interests in trumpet, guitar, and eventually bass with beautiful detail.  The middle section of the interview is filled with incredible detail as Benjy recounts his time playing music in his adolescence as well as his work as a student at The New School at New York University.  The section ends with Benjy’s descriptions of his final project, and how that concert led him into the career he is now pursuing today.&lt;br&gt;The last portion of the interview focuses on Benjy’s conceptions of his work, his involvement with Klezkamp, and his thoughts on Yiddish language and culture.  He discusses his tours in Europe and why he thinks there is an audience for such music, as well as describing those who have helped him and worked with him throughout the years.  The interview ends with Benjy looking towards the future; he explains that he plans to return to school to get a Master’s in composition.

Anna discovered the Book Center with friends who also applied to study during the January term.  Anna shares both the excitement of learning the cultural aspects of the language as well as the difficulties in trying to acquire a new language in one month.  The interview ends with Anna debating what her future plans will be, both as a Yiddish language learner and a student more generally.</teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2011-01-19</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>AnnaMuench19january2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/AnnaMuench19january2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Yiddish language,Yiddish learning,Advice,United States,Other languages,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Other languages, Favorite Yiddish word, Yiddish words, English language, stories, anthropology, Russian, culture, Yiddish language, Yiddish learning, Advice, Yiddishland, Books, </uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Anna Muench</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Anna</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Muench</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1991</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Beverley, MA</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>845</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>846</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn_AAfuaXu4 </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2626</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/pomegranate-red</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>847</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>848</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>849</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>850</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f3-kMxzJD8 </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2625</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/why-learn-yiddish-0</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>851</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXXTr3mYJsc </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2624</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/a-whirlwind-adventure-yiddishland</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>852</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iii74Xf-UIY</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2623</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/why-yiddish</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>102</interview_id><interview_abstract>Sarah Ramsay Leimenstoll, Yiddish language student in the January term intensive at the Yiddish Book Center, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on February 28, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. </interview_abstract><teaser_text>Sarah Ramsay Leimenstoll, Yiddish language student in the January term intensive at the Yiddish Book Center, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on February 28, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. </teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish in the Academy: scholars, language instructors, and students</interview_interview_series><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center -

Frances’s mother was an immigrant to the United States from Ponovitch, Lithuania, while her father came from outside Ponovitch. They met and married in the United States. Frances remembers thinking her mother was illiterate, but after she died Frances realized she could read and write (in addition to speak, of course) Yiddish. Frances also found her mother’s siddur (prayer book) in Yiddish and Hebrew after she died. Her mother, she said, never really felt like an American or spoke much English.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frances described Auburn as it was when she was growing up there. It was poorer than Lewiston, the adjacent town. Auburn was mostly French-Canadian, but there was a small Jewish community there. Her family settled there when an uncle went and wrote back to his family that it was cheap to buy a house; it turned out, as the family legend goes, that when the rest of the family arrived they found out he had meant to say “horse.” In Auburn, everyone knew each other, but still Frances described the self-segregation of Jews in the area. All of her friends were Jewish. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frances moved to Dorchester as a young child. She described the different Jewish neighborhoods of the Greater Boston Area at the time, including Newton, Brookline, and Dorchester. In Dorchester, the students were ethnically mixed in school but self-segregating socially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frances attended Brandeis University in the very early years of its existence, from 1953-1957. At Brandeis, Jewishness became a backdrop to Frances’s and the other students’ identities. The milieu of Brandeis, according to Frances, was very different from many other colleges and universities at the time. The social atmosphere was laidback (no dress codes, for example) and there was an emphasis on open debate in the classroom. She talked about the thrilling experiences of being around intellectual hotshots of the time, many of whom were émigrés and could not get posts in other universities. But, she said, there was noticeable discrimination against women faculty, who were often relegated to low-status positions despite their skills and knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frances shared stories about specific professors she encountered when she was at Brandeis. One of them, Lewis Coser, pressured her to go to graduate school because he saw promise in her as a student; she couldn’t face him when she decided to go on to get a degree in social work because she seemed to think he would be disappointed. She also talked about Joseph Cheskis, who presented some radical salary redistribution ideas at a faculty event that Frances was staffing. Frances noticed a lot of pressure to maintain a clean image of Brandeis for the outside world because it was so new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frances traveled to Israel around the time when she was in college, and she remembered this as the first time she really felt like an American, rather than a Jew born in America. She stayed on a kibbutz and the experience de-romanticized many of her preconceived notions about what a kibbutz was. She also felt the pressure, when talking about Israel to Americans, not to criticize the country. In Israel, at the time, Frances said a tourist could get by using Yiddish rather than Hebrew.

She was five months pregnant when they married.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked about the political organizations she is involved in, Frances said she is more of a supporter than an activist. This was a fundamental part of her identity, supporting left-of-center political organizations. But she does not consider herself an extreme leftist. She supported the Kerry and Obama campaigns, as well as some organizations that deal with political issues in Israel like J Street. This reminded Frances of when she was involved in labor organizing in the 1960s, which she remembered as a very exciting time in her life and in history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As advice to the next generation of Jews, Frances suggested an observance of the Jewish calendar is important to maintaining a Jewish lifestyle. She applauded the Yiddish Book Center’s shabbes (Sabbath) and Jewish holiday closure.

Frances’s mother was an immigrant to the United States from Ponovitch, Lithuania, while her father came from outside Ponovitch. They met and married in the United States. Frances remembers thinking her mother was illiterate, but after she died Frances realized she could read and write (in addition to speak, of course) Yiddish. Frances also found her mother’s siddur (prayer book) in Yiddish and Hebrew after she died. Her mother, she said, never really felt like an American or spoke much English.Frances described Auburn as it was when she was growing up there. It was poorer than Lewiston, the adjacent town. Auburn was mostly French-Canadian, but there was a small Jewish community there. Her family settled there when an uncle went and wrote back to his family that it was cheap to buy a house; it turned out, as the family legend goes, that when the rest of the family arrived they found out he had meant to say “horse.” In Auburn, everyone knew each other, but still Frances described the self-segregation of Jews in the area. All of her friends were Jewish. Frances moved to Dorchester as a young child. She described the different Jewish neighborhoods of the Greater Boston Area at the time, including Newton, Brookline, and Dorchester. In Dorchester, the students were ethnically mixed in school but self-segregating socially.Frances attended Brandeis University in the very early years of its existence, from 1953-1957. At Brandeis, Jewishness became a backdrop to Frances’s and the other students’ identities. The milieu of Brandeis, according to Frances, was very different from many other colleges and universities at the time. The social atmosphere was laidback (no dress codes, for example) and there was an emphasis on open debate in the classroom. She talked about the thrilling experiences of being around intellectual hotshots of the time, many of whom were émigrés and could not get posts in other universities. But, she said, there was noticeable discrimination against women faculty, who were often relegated to low-status positions despite their skills and knowledge.Frances shared stories about specific professors she encountered when she was at Brandeis. One of them, Lewis Coser, pressured her to go to graduate school because he saw promise in her as a student; she couldn’t face him when she decided to go on to get a degree in social work because she seemed to think he would be disappointed. She also talked about Joseph Cheskis, who presented some radical salary redistribution ideas at a faculty event that Frances was staffing. Frances noticed a lot of pressure to maintain a clean image of Brandeis for the outside world because it was so new.Frances traveled to Israel around the time when she was in college, and she remembered this as the first time she really felt like an American, rather than a Jew born in America. She stayed on a kibbutz and the experience de-romanticized many of her preconceived notions about what a kibbutz was. She also felt the pressure, when talking about Israel to Americans, not to criticize the country. In Israel, at the time, Frances said a tourist could get by using Yiddish rather than Hebrew. There was a tension between the two languages: Yiddish was perceived as weak or feminine, and there was governmental pressure to curb its use.When asked about her religious life and political life, Frances made the point that holidays are meant to be observed communally. This is part of the reason that she and her husband sent their son to a Jewish day school, despite the fact that they were “public school people.” They wanted to give their son that kind of ingrained Jewish identity.

Frances views ritual as something that cements Jews in their identities and gives them a sense of where they came from.

This was common in Belgium, he explains, and his brothers also hid.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micha’s last name was changed by immigration officers when his parent’s emigrated to Belgium.  This was a problem for many immigrants, and having several names in different branches of the family made it difficult to locate family members after the second world war.  Both of his parents came from Poland in the 1920s, and met in Antwerp.  His mother was an orphan (due to Typhus) from Poland and his father from Lodz.  He recalls how, as the only Jewish child in his school, he was left out of the tradition to visit grandparents on Thursday afternoons.  This was common among his post-Shoah (Holocaust) generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the war, his parents escaped briefly to the South of France, but returned to Brussels.  The entire family hid after the Nazi invasion.  One brother hid with a Flemish family and didn’t recognize his mother after the war.  His parents refused to wear the yellow stars and his mother would recall how his father would break curfew to play cards with friends, but was never caught.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micha recalls when a deportation train was stopped by young underground resistance fighters on april 19, 1943, the same night of the Warsaw ghetto uprising.  Because so many Belgian Jews were hidden, it became hard for Nazis to catch the Jews.  Therefore, starting in Oct 1942, they kept caught people in barracks in [Mekhlin] and developed work camps for them to work for several days before they had enough people to send them off to Auschwitz.  His father-in-law was caught in Jan 1943 and opened the doors of the train from inside using tools he had taken from his work in one of the slave labor camps.  His aunt and father-in-law were on this train, and escaped of 250 people total.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micha grew up in the zionist youth movement Yehuda Noar Khalutsi (Yehuda Banim), but left after a kibbutz aliyah (trip to Israel) in 1961, when he decided kibbutz life was not for him because the Belgians he met there didn’t greet him.  He eventually joined, and then became president of, a young adult organization of people who had left the Zionist movement.  He remembers organizing the first conference for Soviet Jewry in 1971 (the time of the trial of Leningrad), and another in 1976, with many honored high-level Jewish figures in attendance.  In 1965, he began his service in the Belgian navy, where he was one of the only Jews on the ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1975, [Serch Glazfeld], a leader in prosecuting the responsible leaders in the deportation of Jews in France during WORLD War Two, came to Belgian for a conference.  After Glazfeld called for Belgian Jews to do the same, Micha was moved to get involved.  On May 8, 1975 (anniversary of the end of the war) Micha with a friend and a Belgian media crew occupied the flat of [Erst Elas] in Germany near the Danish border, leader of the Nazi police in Brussels, creating a huge media stir, and eventually leading to a trial of three Nazi police involved in the Belgian deportation in 1980.  [Elas] committed suicide the night before the trial.  This was an important step in getting the story of the Nazi occupation in Belgium to be written.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He married a woman he grew up with, but never knew.  They have three children who now live in Brussels, Israel, and Paris.  He joined as an honorary member (and became president in 2000) of the organization of Jewish deportees of Belgium after the 1975 experience in Germany, and was involved in survivors’ education on Belgian schools.  He has been involved in helping the organization of hidden children, though he declined to join as he didn’t have the shared memory that they had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He recalls many survivors visiting his home growing up, and how they never asked him to leave the room.  Camp and hidden children survivors often waited longer to tell their stories—he remembers seeing people at the beach with tattoos on their arms saying that they had written their phone numbers there, for fear of forgetting—and it wasn’t until their grandchildren were born that many began to talk of their experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wholesale leather good business closed around 2003, and became the Yiddish librarian and tour guide for the Jewish Museum in Brussels.  Most of the visitors to the museum are not Jewish, though Jewish visitors often realize how much they don’t know when they visit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yiddish is disappearing today in Belgium, as in France and Israel, even as people return to study Yiddish as a culture rather than language.  He recalls the Belgian weekly part of a Yiddish newspaper that is no longer, recounts how he occasionally tries to speak Yiddish with his friends, and laments how he thinks Yiddish is “finished” for the next generation, unless something extraordinary happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He talks about the importance of giving his children a Jewish (religious) education, and passing on a sense of Jewishness, no matter what they did with it afterwards.  Micha always had a strong intuitive sense of his Jewishness, without knowing exactly where it came from, and even though his brothers didn’t share this sense.  Today, he is the Jewish leader of the family, and his two brothers come to the Jewish holidays he organizes. One of the ways he keeps his Jewishness is to very strictly not eat even one crumb of bread during Pesakh.  There have been very funny stories that came about because of this… but it is something he feels very strong about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micha is well aware of the importance of the individuality in identity—it doesn’t all depend on education.  This is exemplified by the difference between himself and his brothers, and between his three children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over his lifetime, positions of leadership found him without his seeking them out.  Most recently, the orthodox community asked him to become president, but he doesn’t even keep kosher, not is he shomer shabat!  Similarly, he asked if he could help at his children’s dayschool.  One night he was selling raffle tickets and before long he was on the steering committee!

Berman, born in Antwerp, Belgium before World War Two, was interviewed by Emma Morgenstern on November 10, 2010 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bermant is an 83-year-old widow from Antwerp, Belgium, currently living in Amherst, Massachusetts. Lili started the interview talking about her upbringing in Belgium before the outbreak of World War II. Both of her parents were Jewish, her mother from a religious family in Poland. Her mother, wanting to get a better education, came to Belgium from Poland. She spoke German and French. Lili’s father spoke Flemish and Yiddish, but as Lili said, somehow they made it work. Lili’s father was a diamond broker in Antwerp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Nazi occupation of Belgium brought on a series of attempted and realized escapes to other parts of Europe and eventually the United States. When Lili’s parents felt it was dangerous, the whole family (including Lili’s grandfather), traveled to a series of three towns on the border of France and Belgium in order to seek refuge. They eventually crossed the border into France and spent several days walking across the countryside, trying to avoid the invading German troops. Lili talked about what it was like to walk with all of their belongings and to stay in cramped French farmhouses during their journey. The family had to turn around, however, when they encountered a family coming from the opposite direction that was doing just the same: trying to escape invading German troops. At that point, Lili’s family returned to the border towns and were eventually told they had to go back to Antwerp, where they had come from. Luckily, their landlady had made the apartment look lived-in so that German troops passed over it as they attempted to find quarters within the city. The apartment still intact, Lili and her family stayed there until again, they felt it was too dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before their second escape, Lili’s father secured false papers somehow. Lili often mentioned, during the interview, that she had no idea how her parents were able to work the system in order to buy papers or secure passage to wherever they needed to go. This time, the family intended to travel from Antwerp to Brussels to Paris to some part of France that was unoccupied. Lili’s grandfather decided he did not want to come; instead, he somehow stayed with a non-Jewish family during the war and survived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili told the story of their train from Brussels to Paris, on an express Berlin to Paris train. The train was too crowded and the family got stuck in the middle of the car, with no compartment. It was very cold, so Lili’s mother asked three Germans in a compartment if the family could squeeze in with them. Lili’s mother, educated in German and a sharp woman, spoke with the German officer about how he was sad to be leaving his family back in Germany to go to Paris. At one point, border control entered the train and demanded the family’s papers; the falsified ones didn’t satisfy the officer, so he demanded a passport. As Lili’s father pretended to look for it, the German officer they shared the compartment with waved away the younger border control officer. As Lili said, her family was saved by a German officer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The family spent a couple of weeks in Paris and then moved on to Nice, the French Riviera, as Lili says. She enjoyed her time there, and life wasn’t too hard. But the family wanted to get to the United States, so they again picked up (after nine months or so) and went to Spain. Lili’s mother somehow met a man who was able to secure better accommodations for them on a boat from Bilbao, Spain, to Havana, Cuba. Lili talked about crossing the Atlantic: the Mexican youngsters who taught her sister some Spanish, eating in first class on the boat, and the boat nearly sinking during a hurricane near the Bahamas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the family arrived in Havana, Lili’s uncle met them, but they were still sent off to a detention camp for a couple of weeks. They eventually were released and stayed in Cuba for four years. Lili completed high school there and her sister worked; the family moved to the United States in 1945, after the war ended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked about Jewish identity, Lili talked about her struggles with being Jewish as a child. She did not like visiting her mother’s family because they were still very religious and she felt uncomfortable. She, in some sense, associated being Jewish with limitations and extra responsibility: not being able to attend public school on Saturdays, being required to attend extra Hebrew school, even though she didn’t get anything out of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili joined the youth group Shomer Hadati in Havana, which was a religious Zionist organization. She enjoyed the social aspect of it, even if it meant becoming more religious – keeping shabbes and such. She fondly remembers reading Yiddish stories and going camping on Friday nights with the youth group. However, she was unable to dance socially because the group was too religious, which was a significant restriction given that she lived in Cuba. At some point, she dropped out of the youth group, which was not a problem since the family moved from Cuba shortly after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili married a Jewish American man, but talked a little bit about her parents’ negative feelings regarding dating non-Jews and dating Americans (rather than Europeans). Lili and her husband ended up moving out of New York City (where they had lived) and raising their family in parts of upstate New York: Poughkeepsie and Woodstock. There were small Jewish communities there, but Lili became disenchanted when a smart, progressive rabbi was let go because he didn’t fit the aura of the Jewish community.

Lili started the interview talking about her upbringing in Belgium before the outbreak of World War II. Both of her parents were Jewish, her mother from a religious family in Poland. Her mother, wanting to get a better education, came to Belgium from Poland. She spoke German and French. Lili’s father spoke Flemish and Yiddish, but as Lili said, somehow they made it work. Lili’s father was a diamond broker in Antwerp.The Nazi occupation of Belgium brought on a series of attempted and realized escapes to other parts of Europe and eventually the United States. When Lili’s parents felt it was dangerous, the whole family (including Lili’s grandfather), traveled to a series of three towns on the border of France and Belgium in order to seek refuge. They eventually crossed the border into France and spent several days walking across the countryside, trying to avoid the invading German troops. Lili talked about what it was like to walk with all of their belongings and to stay in cramped French farmhouses during their journey. The family had to turn around, however, when they encountered a family coming from the opposite direction that was doing just the same: trying to escape invading German troops. At that point, Lili’s family returned to the border towns and were eventually told they had to go back to Antwerp, where they had come from. Luckily, their landlady had made the apartment look lived-in so that German troops passed over it as they attempted to find quarters within the city. The apartment still intact, Lili and her family stayed there until again, they felt it was too dangerous.Before their second escape, Lili’s father secured false papers somehow. Lili often mentioned, during the interview, that she had no idea how her parents were able to work the system in order to buy papers or secure passage to wherever they needed to go. This time, the family intended to travel from Antwerp to Brussels to Paris to some part of France that was unoccupied. Lili’s grandfather decided he did not want to come; instead, he somehow stayed with a non-Jewish family during the war and survived.Lili told the story of their train from Brussels to Paris, on an express Berlin to Paris train. The train was too crowded and the family got stuck in the middle of the car, with no compartment. It was very cold, so Lili’s mother asked three Germans in a compartment if the family could squeeze in with them. Lili’s mother, educated in German and a sharp woman, spoke with the German officer about how he was sad to be leaving his family back in Germany to go to Paris. At one point, border control entered the train and demanded the family’s papers; the falsified ones didn’t satisfy the officer, so he demanded a passport. As Lili’s father pretended to look for it, the German officer they shared the compartment with waved away the younger border control officer. As Lili said, her family was saved by a German officer.The family spent a couple of weeks in Paris and then moved on to Nice, the French Riviera, as Lili says. She enjoyed her time there, and life wasn’t too hard. But the family wanted to get to the United States, so they again picked up (after nine months or so) and went to Spain. Lili’s mother somehow met a man who was able to secure better accommodations for them on a boat from Bilbao, Spain, to Havana, Cuba. Lili talked about crossing the Atlantic: the Mexican youngsters who taught her sister some Spanish, eating in first class on the boat, and the boat nearly sinking during a hurricane near the Bahamas.When the family arrived in Havana, Lili’s uncle met them, but they were still sent off to a detention camp for a couple of weeks. They eventually were released and stayed in Cuba for four years. Lili completed high school there and her sister worked; the family moved to the United States in 1945, after the war ended.When asked about Jewish identity, Lili talked about her struggles with being Jewish as a child. She did not like visiting her mother’s family because they were still very religious and she felt uncomfortable. She, in some sense, associated being Jewish with limitations and extra responsibility: not being able to attend public school on Saturdays, being required to attend extra Hebrew school, even though she didn’t get anything out of it.Lili joined the youth group Shomer Hadati in Havana, which was a religious Zionist organization. She enjoyed the social aspect of it, even if it meant becoming more religious – keeping shabbes and such. She fondly remembers reading Yiddish stories and going camping on Friday nights with the youth group. However, she was unable to dance socially because the group was too religious, which was a significant restriction given that she lived in Cuba. At some point, she dropped out of the youth group, which was not a problem since the family moved from Cuba shortly after.Lili married a Jewish American man, but talked a little bit about her parents’ negative feelings regarding dating non-Jews and dating Americans (rather than Europeans). Lili and her husband ended up moving out of New York City (where they had lived) and raising their family in parts of upstate New York: Poughkeepsie and Woodstock. There were small Jewish communities there, but Lili became disenchanted when a smart, progressive rabbi was let go because he didn’t fit the aura of the Jewish community. This furthered some of her already-held views about Judaism being hypocritical.Lili and her mother had a significant argument about whether or not Lili’s son would become a bar mitzvah. Lili and her husband decided it was not important—her husband had done it, but it meant very little to him. Lili’s mother threatened to never step foot in the house again, but in the end she came to respect their decision.Lili’s mother became a diamond broker when her husband died shortly after they arrived in America. She was a diamond broker until she was 81, and then she took a creative writing class. She wrote stories that Lili collected into a few volumes.

Towards the end of the interview, Wyatt tells the story of his Bar Mitzvah, coupled with a Hawaiian ceremony that parallels the transformation from child to adult.</teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish in the Academy: scholars, language instructors, and students</interview_interview_series><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2011-04-15</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>WyattMiles15april2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/WyattMiles15april2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Favorite Yiddish word, Yiddish words,Family history, stories about ancestors,Childhood,Jewish Identity,Yiddish language,Yiddish learning,Immigration, Migration,Music,Film,Literature,Books,Poetry,Scholarship, Academia,Education,Religion and ritual,Jewish education,Family traditions,Jewish holidays,Pesakh, Passover,Channukah, Khanukah, Channuka, KhanikeOld Country,Eastern Europe,United States,Yiddish Book Center,Food and culinary traditions,Transmission,Roots/heritage,Anti-Semitism,Jewish community,Rural,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Kauai, Los Angeles, Joseph Brodsky, Yiddish Book Center, 1990s, 2000s, displacement, minority, </uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Wyatt Miles</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Wyatt</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Miles</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1991</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Los Angeles, CA</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>815</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>816</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2_mLI7owok</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2675</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/jewish-a-different-way-every-day</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>817</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdrpEcQ6qH8</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2674</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/being-home-anywhere</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>818</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>819</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>820</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6RiJSoYAIY</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2673</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/ocean-my-synagogue</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>821</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>822</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>874</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>875</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZlsCv4wtQ </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2676</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/familiarity-yiddish</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>876</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>877</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>878</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>966</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>968</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUrnFiR0z9Y </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2678</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/experiencing-anti-semitism-hawaii</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>122</interview_id><interview_abstract>Robert Epstein, former educator, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on April 5, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert begins his interview with a brief overview of his family’s settlement in the United States.

When Andrei was born, his family moved to the suburbs of Moscow to a three-bedroom apartment in a five-story building. Andrei went to an English-language-focused school that happened to be next to the music school; Andrei’s grandmother would walk him to and from school. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrei shares stories of the many visitors who came to his home to discuss the work of his grandfather, Isaac Babel.

Nonetheless, Andrei grew up in a very Jewish environment, albeit a Soviet Jewish environment without much religious learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not being surrounded by Yiddish as a child, Andrei’s interest in the Jewish National Theatre and the work of Solomon Mikhoels grew out of his grandmother’s correspondence with Mikhoels.

He explained that both his father and mother immigrated from Eastern Europe—Poland and Ukraine—to Mexico City.  His father left Eastern Europe as a teenager, while his mother left as a young child, both following family members across the ocean.  His uncle had a sock factory, and Boris remembers going once a year to get his year’s supply of socks, many of which were argyle. Passover was the biggest event of the year for his family; he remembers that taking an afternoon nap was necessary to get through the celebration that lasted into the early hours of the morning.  He remembers how his entire family would gather—30-40 people—and read the entire Haggadah in Hebrew.  Songs were an important part of the tradition, too; each year the celebration would get longer, with the addition of new songs, in Hebrew, Yiddish, and even Ladino from a Sephardic uncle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boris remembers his entire world being Jewish in his youth.  He doesn’t remember having any non-Jewish friends until medical school.  Yiddish was the language his parents, grandparents, and great-grandmother spoke, but he didn’t want to associate with it, considering it the “language of galut,” especially after he became involved in the Zionist youth movement.  Boris describes his neighborhood in Mexico City and the geographical closeness of his extended family before describing his numerous moves throughout Mexico. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boris goes on to discuss some of the various Jewish schools in Mexico, including his school, El Colegio Hebreo Tarbut, where he was immersed in Jewish history, learned about Israel, and became quite fluent in Hebrew.  Boris provides immense detail about what he learned at school and how it impacted him as both a child and as an adult.  Boris describes his connection to Yiddish in more detail before explaining his involvement in Jewish youth groups.  He then takes time to detail the importance of his Mexican heritage, which includes descriptions of food, holidays, political movements, and newspapers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At age 16, Boris headed off to Israel for a year.  He initially had difficulty convincing his parents to allow him to go, but once his older sister returned from her year there, he remembers how she helped him convince his parents.  He recalled being seasick the entire two-week journey on the S.S. [Tsion] from New York City to Haifa, but remembers waking up early the day they were to arrive to watch from the deck as the coastline appeared.  He describes his year in Israel as “paradise,” sharing stories about his Hebrew classes, Israeli newspapers and radio, the Eichmann trial, his Israeli dance lessons, and work on a number of different kibbutzim. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having spent the majority of the interview discussing his early life, Boris goes on to discuss his life today.  He shares the story of how he got engaged to his wife and moved to the United States.  His moves from Mexico to Boston to New York saw the addition of two children, a medical degree, and a growing interest in Jewish religious life, which led Boris to become the president of his shul and his wife to become a rabbi.  Boris shares stories of his children’s varying interests in Jewish life and how those developed into their professional lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last portion of the interview begins with a detailed analysis of the differences between being Jewish in Mexico versus being Jewish in the United States.  Boris specifically discusses Jewish particularism and Jewish secularism.  As the interview wraps up, Boris explains the feelings many Ashkenazi Jews had about Sephardim before explaining how the Mexican Jewish community has changed.  Indeed, today it is even possible to find Jewish Mexican food like kosher mole.  The interview ends with Boris sharing the values he hopes to pass on to his children and grandchildren, including his advice to preserve Jewish heritage. &lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Boris Rubinstein, Mexico City-born psychiatrist, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on May 15, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Boris grew up in Mexico City, Mexico.

Boris specifically discusses Jewish particularism and Jewish secularism.  As the interview wraps up, Boris explains the feelings many Ashkenazi Jews had about Sephardim before explaining how the Mexican Jewish community has changed.  Indeed, today it is even possible to find Jewish Mexican food like kosher mole.  The interview ends with Boris sharing the values he hopes to pass on to his children and grandchildren, including his advice to preserve Jewish heritage. </teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish

Kruzansky, teacher of Jewish history, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on June 12, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara grew up in Chicago.  Her parents, from a shtetl and a village in Poland, met in Warsaw, where they were married before her father moved to the U.S. at age 20 to avoid being drafted into the tsarist Russian army.  He participated in the Gaviston movement, a push to move Jewish immigrants to places other than New York City.  After a few years in various cities in the Midwest, her father, shoemaker by trade, followed the garment industry to Chicago.  Sara describes her childhood as very poor.  She grew up in a mostly African-American neighborhood, but her family was all Jewish.  Her parents were religious and observed every Jewish holiday—even the minor ones that some others might have skipped.  She remembers being pulled out of school for every one, and picks out Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur as her favorites, perhaps because they happened around the same time as going back to school.  Every shabbes her mother would cook raisin bread and clean the whole house.  They were not too observant to not turn on the radio, though, and she remembers shabbes as defined by the candle sticks and the radio on the kitchen table, playing the weekly Chicago Jewish radio program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara always loved school.  She remembers specific teachers from gradeschool, especially Miss Johnson, who taught her to read, which was, for Sara, “magic.”  She has been an avid reader her entire life.  She went to religious school as well as public school, and loved them both.  She never had to be taught that she was Jewish, it was simply a part of the home she grew up in.  Both of her parents spoke Yiddish, to each other, and to their children.  She and her older brother would speak back in Yiddish, but her brother would answer in English.  Sara remembers specific Yiddish phrases that her parents, particularly her mother, would use when she was growing up.  Many of them she still uses today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara has three children and seven grandchildren.  Sara never had aunts or uncles or cousins growing up, since her parents were the only members of her family to come to the States.  She remembers her mother being very sad, missing her family in Europe.  Today, she feels a great joy that her grandchildren have cousins and a large family since they all live near her in Danbury, CT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She fell into teaching, wasn’t planning on going into it, but has found it very rewarding.  Jewish history has become a passion of hers, and she especially loves teaching about the Middle Ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was the foundation of the state of Israel that stands out most in Sara’s mind when she looks back over the historical events she lived through.  She remembers standing in the Chicago stadium and listening to the broadcast of Ben Gurion’s address.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara has traveled to Eastern Europe several times.  When she went to visit the town her mother grew up in, she was asked by a PeaceCorps worker to talk to an English class because they had never met a Jewish person before.  Sara was surprised to not feel much emotion on this visit; it was then a city of 20,000, not the town her mother grew up in, and there was no sign of the Jewish culture that once was prominent there.  She felt similarly on another trip to Ukraine, that Eastern Europe is a sad place.  It was only on one trip, in the late 70s, to Rumania that she made some emotional connections when she was able to visit and speak to families there in Yiddish.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Sara, Yiddish is mostly an academic language today.  As a spoken language, it died along with the speakers during the Holocaust.  She is grateful to have learned it from her parents, and also to read and write it to fulfill a college requirement when she went back for her masters after some of her children had already graduated.  For Sara, Yiddish is the language of her parents, and she has much emotional attachment to it because of her love of them.  She remembers her father reading several different Yiddish newspapers in the home; he especially loved Peretz’ stories.  She doesn’t really believe in the revival of the language.  Sara enjoyed her religious education much more than her brothers did.  While they had a melamid, she learned Hebrew and Yiddish, Jewish history, and songs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many things have changed through generations, Sara says.  Showing a picture from the old country, she points out the difference in dress between parents and children.  Coming to America, she and her siblings were very different from her parents.  Looking at her grandchildren, there are huge differences, too, the biggest being rates of intermarriage.  Sara leaves her grandchildren with the advice to be determined, but flexible, for you never know what life will throw you.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Sara Kruzansky, teacher of Jewish history, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on June 12, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Sara grew up in Chicago.

Schlitt, 2010-2011 Yiddish Book Center Fellow, was interviewed by Lesley Yalen on May 20, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David was a 2010-2011 Yiddish Book Center Fellow. His family originally comes from Lithuania, Romania, and Moldova. They mostly immigrated to the US before World War I. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David grew up in Brookline, MA, with his mother and father, both of whom have been interviewed for the Wexler Oral History Project. Jewish identity was very consciously expressed and transmitted in his household; his parents sent him to a Solomon Schechter Day School, brought him to Workmen’s Circle events, and eventually joined a synagogue. His mother participated in Torah study while his father was more of a secularist. David himself brought home from school an interest in Jewish observance and religious participation. His parents also brought liberal/leftist political discussion and action into the home, and that has also informed David’s Jewish identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art and culture were priorities for his family. David took art and music classes for years and was influenced deeply by his teachers. His experience at the Schechter school was largely difficult, as he felt unsupported by teachers there. However, his art teacher there was one of the positive forces during those years. He flourished more at Brookline High School, where he felt much more supported and also (ironically) became more engrossed in religious and spiritual matters through independent investigation and study at the extracurricular Prozdor Hebrew School.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David began studying Yiddish at the Yiddish Book Center the summer before he went to college. He went on to study it at Columbia University, at the Vilna summer program, and twice in the YIVO summer program. The language certainly connects him to his grandparents and parents, but he doesn’t feel a sense of familial/historical burden about it—it feels lighter than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David’s current academic work as a PhD student in history at the University of Michigan is about multi-use sports stadiums—not a Jewish studies topic. This was a conscious decision for him, as his earlier work on Jewish labor movements began to feel too heavy, too personal, too interconnected with his own family history. He needed to separate from that a little to remember some of the things that have always interested him independently from his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>David Schlitt, 2010-2011 Yiddish Book Center Fellow, was interviewed by Lesley Yalen on May 20, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. David was a 2010-2011 Yiddish Book Center Fellow.

Strear (poultry farmer) and Albert “Booney” Dinner (cattle rancher), cousins, were interviewed in Denver, Colorado on July 6, 2011. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Albert was born and raised in Greeley, Colorado, and Leonard was born in Detroit and grew up in Denver. The two cousins talk about their shared family history, their childhoods in Colorado, and their lives as Jewish farmers there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Leonard spent much of his time working for his father, a poultry farmer. He describes waking up at 4:30 am to pick up truckloads of poultry from farms and cream stations that they would then bring into Denver to sell. Later, his father bought a farm where they raised turkeys. Leonard’s parents were fluent in Yiddish, but he says they spoke English all the time. Their family observed all the Jewish holidays, and Leonard attended Hebrew afternoon school until he was thirteen years old. He recalls the European teachers at the Hebrew school who enforced discipline with little switches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Albert grew up in a traditional, orthodox household. He says his father was “very adamant about being Jewish,” and remembers that he garnered respect from the community because of it. The family got kosher meat from Denver, observed the holidays, and sent their children to Hebrew school. Albert learned to understand some Yiddish, and his older siblings could speak it. At the same time, he got along very well with his Christian friends in Greeley. He was very involved in school, and was captain of the football and tennis teams. Albert’s father was a cattle farmer, and he tells stories about driving cattle, riding in the Greeley rodeo, and taking a caboose ride to Chicago on a cattle train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leonard and Albert also discuss their different experiences during World War Two. Leonard was drafted into the army as a medical man in the Second Infantry Division, and was part of the Invasion of Normandy and many major battles. Alfred was stationed at Army Post Office 610 in Keflavik, Iceland, where the U.S. Air Force had a base. Both cousins discuss their encounters with anti-Semitism, and their experience that if you defend your station in life, you will win the respect of others.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The two cousins tell stories about their family history and the values that their parents passed on to them, as well as their own experiences as parents. They remember Kiddush at the Strear family’s warehouse office, with such delicacies as pletzl and p’tcha, and plenty of liquor. They talk about balancing business with a sense of Jewish identity, and trying to pass on that Jewish identity to their children. Together, they reflect on the importance of passion and compassion, and of being true to oneself.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Leonard Strear (poultry farmer) and Albert “Booney” Dinner (cattle rancher), cousins, were interviewed in Denver, Colorado on July 6, 2011. Albert was born and raised in Greeley, Colorado, and Leonard was born in Detroit and grew up in Denver.

With two parents from Wales, Charles remembers his life in the newly developed, liberal democratic, and diverse town of Win Garden City in the United Kingdom.  His life growing up was very secular, and he remembers the tolerance of his community.  He reminisces about how the town's shul was built next to the Friend's meeting house, as one of many examples of his town's common ongoings.  Charles describes his time growing up as very educationally focused, however, he remembers school sports and outings as a particularly enjoyable time in his childhood.&lt;br&gt;Charles describes his move from the United Kingdom to the United States, a move guided by his decision to follow his education at St. Johns College at Cambridge in mathematics and astrophysics with a doctorate in astrophysics and fluid dynamics from Columbia University.  When Charles arrived in New York he explains how his Jewish identity developed in a way it never had before.  It was in New York that Charles learned Yiddish.  He retells stories of sitting in the Jewish Theological Seminary library, meeting Yiddish speakers on park benches, and his parents’ interest in his Yiddish language acquisition.  &lt;br&gt;The interview goes on to cover Charles’ career in technological innovation as well as museum work and his move to Boulder, Colorado where he now resides.  Charles talks about his current Yiddish use, his running and mountain climbing, and describes how his Jewish experience of running on Shabbes differs from others in his community.  This section of the interview also covers the incredible story of how Charles’ project at his alma mater, Cambridge, literally unearthed an 11th century Jewish community.

She explains how Daniel Mendelsohn’s book “The Lost” prompted the emergence of her family’s history, leaving her able to share what she does at the start of the interview.&lt;br&gt;Following a detailed explanation of her lineage, Martha dives into her life growing up in a Jewish home.  Her mother and father were radical Zionists, though she spent her life growing up in Bloomfield, New Jersey.  Martha lived in a kosher home, went to Camp Ramah, and belonged to a conservative temple.  Living in Bloomfield, New Jersey, however, Martha was keenly aware of being one of only a handful of Jews in her school, which she explains, often felt alienating.&lt;br&gt;Roughly one third of the way into the interview, Martha shares a pivotal moment in her life.  When she was younger, Martha describes how boys were the only adolescents given the chance to sing for the high holidays.  She describes that one year, the cantor let her sit in and listen while the boy trained for the high holidays.  When the high holidays arrived, the young boy became ill.  The cantor, to Martha’s surprise, asked her to sing.  The experience of leading the service as a woman has stuck with Martha her entire life.&lt;br&gt;About halfway into the interview, Martha begins a thrilling explanation of her involvement in the Chavarah movement; a movement that arose in the late 60s as part of broader countercultural movements.  The Chavarah movement formed largely out of the conservative movement whose participants felt alienated within the large suburban synagogue.  Martha tells with picturesque detail the stories of her involvement with the Chavarah movement to this day.&lt;br&gt;Following her descriptions of Chavarah, Martha shares her experience as a feminist and a Jew.  It is within the last portion of her interview that Martha provides powerful stories of how she and other women decided that Judaism did not align with feminist goals.  Filled with stories of protest and social change, the last part of the interview is especially interesting for those with a desire to learn more about Jews and feminism.&lt;br&gt;The interview ends with Martha describing her recent travels to Cordoba, Spain where she lived as the academic director for Preshco (Programa de Estudios Hispánicos en Córdoba) a junior year abroad program for students at Oberlin College, Smith College, The College of Wooster, Trinity College, Wellesley College, and Wheaton College (MA).  In these final moments of the interview, Martha shares her experience as an Ashkenazi Jew in a seemingly Jewless area in Spain.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Martha Ackelsberg, Professor of Government and the Study of Women and Gender at Smith College, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on September 13, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Martha's family history pours out of her in meticulous detail as she explains that her maternal grandmother was born in the United States, her maternal grandfather was from Galicia, and her paternal grandfather was from the Ukraine.

London, founding member of the Klezmatics and Frank London's All-Star Klezmer Brass Ensemble, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on August 24, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frank's interview begins with an interesting dive into his familial heritage.  Frank weaves through the half finished stories he’s picked up in his lifetime, and deduces that as far as he knows, he’s at least third generation American on both sides of his family.  Though little of his family’s geographical history is known to him, Frank tells numerous stories of his family’s reputation as they moved in and around New York City and Connecticut.&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Frank had very little Yiddish in his life.  Though he had a suburban reform Jewish upbringing, Frank explains how he did not really see any Jewish cultural aspects in his childhood—only glimmers that surface in retrospect.  As such, Frank's memories of his childhood circulate around music.  It was in fourth grade that Frank decided to play the trumpet, and from then on, his interest in music blossomed— especially his love for rock and roll.  After finishing school, Frank went to college for a year, but left to finish his education at the New England Conservatory.&lt;br&gt;At the Conservatory, Frank studied many forms of music, as he recalls this particular educational experience as the point in his life when music became much larger than rock and roll.  Frank beautifully details his first encounter with Jewish music—that is music other than synagogue music—through his now close friend and colleague Hankus Netsky who was a classmate at the New England Conservatory.  Frank explains how his Klezmer band formed through a mandatory concert on Jewish music with great ease.&lt;br&gt;By the middle of the interview, Frank begins discussing a number of his current projects which includes teaching world music at SUNY Purchase, his three projects at the Singer festival in Warsaw, his work with the Klezmer Brass Allstars, and many more.  Discussing his new projects, Frank focuses for the nearly the last half of the interview on his inspiration and creative process for his new Yiddish opera.  As Frank reflects on his reasons and challenges in writing a Yiddish opera he is led to reflect on the role of Yiddish.

Daniel's mother was born in Detroit, Michigan, and his father was born in Akron, Ohio. Daniel's four grandparents lived in many different hubs across the nation including the Lower East Side, Wisconsin, and Ohio.  Though a self-proclaimed, American, Daniel reflects on his mother’s family’s Galician past, and how his father's family left Austria-Hungary for England before immigrating to the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Daniel went to Temple Israel in West Bloomfield, Michigan where he was Bar Mitzvahed, celebrated holidays, and sang in choirs.  By the age of 12, Daniel became involved in acting, and worked at the Jewish Ensemble Theatre in Detroit, Michigan.  Though Daniel felt increasingly alienated from the Jewish suburban mentality, his work in the theatre bolstered his culturally Jewish identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The political atmosphere in Detroit greatly shaped Daniel's worldview at a very young age.  Daniel retells his consciousness of racism and union work throughout the interview, detailing his interest in folk music, political protest songs, and African American cultural production.  His interest in race politics developed as he situated himself, a privileged white male, into his work with class politics.  These notions developed in Daniel's college theatre work that became heavily influenced by Bertolt Brecht, Augusto Boal, and Paulo Freire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Daniel was a teenager, he went to New Orleans.  On this trip he heard the New Orleans Klezmer Allstars.  Though he had some knowledge of Yiddish culture, it was this moment that peaked Daniel's interest in Klezmer.  When Daniel moved to New Orleans in 2001, he became more involved with Klezmer and Yiddish.  By 2004, Daniel was singing a lot of Yiddish and was invited to Klezkanada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the middle of the interview, Daniel goes into detail about what attracted him to Yiddish as a singer/songwriter.  He describes the moment he heard Michael Albrecht sing Yiddish on the Brave Old World Songs of Lodz Ghetto album.  The sound captured him, and it was this experience that influenced his decision to continue working in Yiddish.  Yiddish was no longer a language of nostalgia, but a language ready for recontexualization and use for a contemporary audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel eventually travelled to Berlin and the Krakow Jewish Festival.  This move allowed Daniel to begin work with Psoy Kordenko; a collaborative relationship he is deeply invested in today.  Daniel traveled to New York in 2008 and completed the YIVO program.  Though deeply interested in the use of Yiddish, Daniel is clear that his use of Yiddish varies as he is more interested in storytelling and the multiethnic conversation his music is involved in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The end of the interview focuses on Daniel's insights into Yiddish culture, Yiddish cultural revival, and the way Yiddish has been transmitted and his work in this process.

She explains that all four of her grandparents lived in Chicago, which was where her parents met, though her mother grew up near Berkley, California, and her father lived near Denver, Colorado.  Sarah’s paternal grandmother was born in Russia and came with her family in 1923 to America.  Her paternal grandfather was born in the United States.  Sarah recalls that her paternal grandparents were part of the intelligentsia, unlike her maternal grandparents who were much more religious.  Sarah’s maternal family came from Lithuania in the 1920s, or possibly earlier, moving through Canada before arriving in the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah spends much of the first portion of the interview sharing family stories; stories, she explains, she didn’t know much of until later in her life.  Sarah then goes on to talk about her life growing up in New York, in YIVO, and with a father who was a cantor and mother who was a Yiddish singer.  This portion of the interview is filled with great detail about an earlier time in the Yiddish scene, which Sarah recounts with incredible imagery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah then moves on to discuss her own education at the Abraham Joshua Heschel School in Manhattan, a Jewish, equalitarian, progressive school that she attended until she started in a Quaker high school.  She graduated from Sarah Lawrence, where she spent her junior year abroad in Israel, and eventually got her Master’s in education and as a literacy specialist for elementary education.  During this portion of the interview, Sarah describes how she came to realize she wanted to work with Yiddish language and music, which leads into a discussion on her current projects with her band Yiddish Princess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Briefly going over what life was like with Adrienne Cooper as her mother, Sarah spends the latter portion of the interview talking about her own work and her interest in words and music before divulging her feelings on Yiddish revival and transmission of Yiddish culture.  Sarah ends the interview reflecting on the way the Yiddish scene has changed, with many survivors and older generations of Yiddish speakers passing away.  Sarah returns to the question of revival and innovation within Yiddish culture, ending her interview advising others to simply begin engaging in the Yiddish world.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Sarah Gordon - lead singer for Yiddish Princess, a Brooklyn-based Yiddish-language rock band, and daughter of Yiddish singer Adrienne Cooper - was interviewed by Christa Whitney on August 25, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada. Sarah begins her interview detailing her family’s history.

Sarah’s maternal family came from Lithuania in the 1920s, or possibly earlier, moving through Canada before arriving in the United States.Sarah spends much of the first portion of the interview sharing family stories; stories, she explains, she didn’t know much of until later in her life.  Sarah then goes on to talk about her life growing up in New York, in YIVO, and with a father who was a cantor and mother who was a Yiddish singer.  This portion of the interview is filled with great detail about an earlier time in the Yiddish scene, which Sarah recounts with incredible imagery.Sarah then moves on to discuss her own education at the Abraham Joshua Heschel School in Manhattan, a Jewish, equalitarian, progressive school that she attended until she started in a Quaker high school.  She graduated from Sarah Lawrence, where she spent her junior year abroad in Israel, and eventually got her Master’s in education and as a literacy specialist for elementary education.  During this portion of the interview, Sarah describes how she came to realize she wanted to work with Yiddish language and music, which leads into a discussion on her current projects with her band Yiddish Princess.Briefly going over what life was like with Adrienne Cooper as her mother, Sarah spends the latter portion of the interview talking about her own work and her interest in words and music before divulging her feelings on Yiddish revival and transmission of Yiddish culture.  Sarah ends the interview reflecting on the way the Yiddish scene has changed, with many survivors and older generations of Yiddish speakers passing away.  Sarah returns to the question of revival and innovation within Yiddish culture, ending her interview advising others to simply begin engaging in the Yiddish world.</teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish and the Performing Artists: musicians, actors, and artists;Yiddish and the Arts: musicians, actors, and artists</interview_interview_series><interview_location>KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada. </interview_location><interview_date>2011-08-25</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>SarahGordon25august2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/SarahGordon25august2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Family history and stories re. ancestors,Childhood,Jewish Identity,Yiddish language (feelings of/about, meaning, descriptions of),Yiddish revival and activism,Scholarship,Israel,United States,Music,Jewish community (descriptions of place and social dynamics in a particular time),children/grandchildren of (Yiddish personalities),Yiddish learning,Career and Professional Life,Transmission (intergenerational, cultural, social... parenting),Post-vernacular uses of Yiddish,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Bina Veinreich, Klezmer, Yiddish Princess, Jacob Glatstein, Itzik Manger, Adrienne Cooper, Yiddish Princess, KlezKamp, KlezKanada, YIVO</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Sarah Gordon</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Sarah</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Gordon</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1979</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>New York, New York</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>543</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>544</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StJ3t2GFjUU </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2921</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/hello-yivo-memories-growing-up-little-mascot-yivo</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>545</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBsElUfHJ5U </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2926</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/a-very-telling-dream</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>546</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIeL54_ENVI </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2925</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/a-yiddish-american-princess</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>547</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWNuyKG6XYw&amp;feature=youtu.be</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2922</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/weight-her-shoulders</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>155</interview_id><interview_abstract>Assaf Talmudi - Israel-based music producer, researcher, and accordionist for Oy Division - was interviewed by Christa Whitney on August 24, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Assaf Talmudi begins the interview describing his family’s lineage: His paternal grandmother and grandfather and his maternal grandfather were from Poland, and his maternal grandmother was from Holland.  Assaf details how each of his grandparents made their way to Israel, which illuminates interesting historical migrations through Poland, Russia, and Africa as well as migrations directly from Poland to Israel.  Growing up Assaf remembers only speaking Hebrew, though he remarks that his grandparents often spoke Polish and Yiddish.  His parents were born in Haifa in the 1940s, and raised Assaf in a suburb outside of Tel Aviv.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Assaf went to an arts high school where he studied jazz and modern music.  Upon graduation, he began his service in the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) where he worked on the IDF radio station and taught music and put on musical programs. When Assaf finished his service, he went to the Royal Conservatory in Holland where he studied composition, primarily radical, experimental music.  Following his time in Holland he travelled in Italy before returning to Israel where he began work on his doctorate in musicology, as well as doing work in Artificial Intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assaf remembers about five years ago when he attended KlezKanada for the first time, as well as started learning the accordion.  At this point the interview shifts into a discussion about Assaf's musical work and interest in klezmer.  He describes his first experience at KlezKanada and the experience he gained from working with Josh Horowitz and Walter Feldman.  When he returned home from KlezKanada, Assaf began the band Oy Division with some colleagues in Tel Aviv.  What started as a hobby, Assaf recalls, quickly became a profession as his band’s first two albums received good reviews in both Israel and Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last half of the interview focuses primarily on the appeal, revival, and transmission of klezmer music and Yiddish culture.  Assaf talks in depth about the appealing nature for Eastern European klezmer folk music for people who have interests in experimental music.  He goes on to remark on the role musicians have in playing and performing folk music, sharing his thoughts on whether or not the musician transmits music or simply plays for a willing, and already interested, audience.  Assaf takes time to detail the polemical issues surrounding Yiddish folk music in Israel, iterating the complex socio-historical move away from Yiddish as Israel moved towards a nationalist state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The interview ends with Assaf’s brief comments on the way music transmits Yiddish language, the role of the musician as activist, and the pleasures of teaching Yiddish music.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Assaf Talmudi - Israel-based music producer, researcher, and accordionist for Oy Division - was interviewed by Christa Whitney on August 24, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada.  Assaf Talmudi begins the interview describing his family’s lineage: His paternal grandmother and grandfather and his maternal grandfather were from Poland, and his maternal grandmother was from Holland.

His mother was born in 1942 in Eastern Prussia, and was educated to become a teacher, but later became a sculpterist.  His father, born in 1937 in Bremen, Germany, was a Protestant pastor. Growing up Christian was not exposed to Jewish culture, as he explains that Bremen had a very small Jewish population, and an even smaller display of Jewish public life.  His only knowledge of Jewish culture came from his father’s interest in religion. This interview, taken at Klezkanada 2011, reviews Christian’s musical training, his relationship to klezmer music and folk music more generally, and begins to unpack his experience performing klezmer music as a non-Jew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian spent the first thirty years of his life in Bremen where he studied music. After many private clarinet lessons and numerous performances in choirs and orchestras, Christian spent five years in the Bremen conservatory. When Christian left conservatory, he decided to pursue musical opportunities outside of the orchestral scene. At this time, Klezmer began to enter the 1990s German cultural consciousness. With the Klezmatics, Giora Feidman’s solo albums, the Klezmer conservatory band, and Klezmorim as guides, Christian began writing what he thought was klezmer music.  In 1995, at a klezmer workshop in Germany, Christian revised his technique and understanding of klezmer, learning some Yiddish along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian has performed and taught at many klezmer camps and festivals around the world, and finds that in the tight knit community of Yiddishland he is continually learning more about his interest in klezmer music and the traditions embedded within the folk music.  During the middle section of the interview, Christian details his current projects which include work with a Ukranian brass band, projects with American trumpeter Paul Brody, a new project entitled “Bluer than Blue,” and an attempt to record 89 year old Ukrainian singer Arkady Gendler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thirty minutes of the interview focuses on Christian’s personal musings on his involvement in Yiddishland, klezmer music, and inevitably, the Jewish community given his non-Jewish background.  Christian grounds this conversation in his role as a musician.  He explains that many musicians have always been transnational, identifying with different rhythms and scales regardless of their nationality or ethnicity.  Christian consistently remarks on his interest in people, the older generation, and the connections made between peoples.  Chsitian connects this interest to klezmer’s ability to both look back and recreate traditional sounds from a time when the music was more firmly rooted to land while looking forward to new intonations and stylings that emerge from the current moment of klezmer musicians and audiences alike. &lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Christian Dawid, Berlin-based klezmer clarinet player, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on August 23, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada. Christian is a musician who grew up in Bremen, Germany.

Winograd, lauded Brooklyn-based klezmer clarinet player, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on August 24, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael begins his interview by briefly describing his family as half Russian and half Polish.  Michael explains that his family wanted to become American, and when they arrived in the United States in the late nineteenth century they did not speak very much about their life in Europe.  It wasn’t until Michael’s paternal great uncle moved to Brooklyn that he received a number of photographs that represented a family history he had never learned about before.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though his family did not speak much about Europe, Michael explains that he grew up in a Jewish home on Long Island, went to Hebrew school, Camp Rama in the Berkshires for his summers, and lived in a house where Mickey Katz and Irving Fields were often played.  Michael continues to describe how his father listened to a lot of music that most likely affected his own interest in musical forms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael then describes his early musical experience, beginning with piano then learning saxophone and finally settling on clarinet which he studied at the New England Conservatory.  Though Michael does not speak Yiddish, he details how he feels like he knows more than he would readily admit, describing situations when he has performed and his unknown language skills have come in handy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The middle section of the interview focuses on Michael’s current work with klezmer music, his numerous collaborators, his travels, and his work as both teacher and performer.  Michael explains that klezmer music has taken him from Klezkamps in the late 1990s to islands off of the African coast.  Michael remarks that the multi-generational world of klezmer has been most incredible for him as he has worked his way up through the ranks.  This leads Michael to divulge the changes he has seen in the klezmer world since he was introduced to it at the age of fourteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of the interview Michael talks about his role as a performing artist, both as an activist, and as a scholar and teacher of klezmer music.  Michael ends the interview describing his work with the band Yiddish Princess, advising listeners not to get too stressed out by parental concerns and just get into the music.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Michael Winograd, lauded Brooklyn-based klezmer clarinet player, was interviewed by Pauline Katz on August 24, 2011 at KlezKanada in the Laurentian Mountains of Canada.Michael begins his interview by briefly describing his family as half Russian and half Polish.

Kaye, Navy veteran and officer on the Haganah ship Hatikvah, was interviewed by Hillary Ossip on July 28, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul begins by describing his family background. His father, whose original family name was Kamenetsky, came from Odessa and his mother from Lemberg (also known as Lwow or Lviv). They met on the Lower East Side of New York City. His father spoke only Yiddish, but his mother became fluent in English. Paul was born on the Lower East Side in 1927, but the family moved to a neighborhood near Tremont Avenue in The Bronx when he was four months old. Arthur Avenue, where they lived, was all Yiddish, but there were Italian and Irish neighborhoods on either side of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Paul was only eight, his father died. He recounts that as an “orphan,” he became a Bar Mitzvah a year early, at age twelve. He was educated in Hebrew at a little shtibl (a small, one-room synagogue) across from his apartment and became a Bar Mitzvah at Fordham Talmud Torah on 181st St. He describes his mother as “super Orthodox,” keeping a kosher home with live fish in the bathtub before the Sabbath. Paul was horrified the first time he saw milk together with meat in the Navy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the family was poor, Paul has fond memories of his childhood and his mother’s cooking, specifically knedlakh (matzah balls) and hamantashen (triangular Purim pastries) with coins in them for luck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul attended public schools in The Bronx. He wanted to be an engineer, but through a misunderstanding was sent to Chelsea High School, a vocational school in Manhattan. He graduated during World War II. He had hoped to join the Marines to fight in World War II, but he didn’t meet all the requirements. Instead, he joined the Navy in 1945 after a chance meeting with a friend in Grand Central Terminal. The Navy sent him to engineering school and he had orders to prepare for an invasion of Japan, but the orders were rescinded after the atomic bomb was dropped. His mother passed away on the day he was discharged from the Navy, which was a defeating blow to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After returning home in 1947, while waiting to continue studying engineering at college and working at a record shop, he received a call from a mysterious man recruiting him for a mission. The next day he sailed out of Baltimore as an engineer on the Hatikvah, a sister ship to the Exodus, hoping to bring Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine. In the Azores they were able to obtain fuel after someone overheard him speaking Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They took Displaced Persons onboard in Italy, but the Hatikvah was intercepted by the British, and the people were taken to detention camps in Cyprus. Everyone there spoke Yiddish, and Paul recounts how on one occasion speaking Yiddish saved him and a friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After British Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan told President Truman that the captured Exodus ship and those aboard were being taken to Cyprus when they were really being taken back to Germany, the Jewish defense organization Haganah decided to blow up a British prison ship. Paul gives a vivid description of how the charges were set and how the ship was barely evacuated before it blew up in the Haifa harbor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul was then held in the Atlit detention camp in Palestine, established by the authorities of the British Mandate for Palestine to prevent Jewish refugees from entering Palestine, but he escaped. He joined the fledgling Israeli Navy and was a member of its first Seal unit, even though he did not know how to swim; he spent the 1948 Israeli War of Independence in the Seals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once he returned to the United States, Paul got a Bachelor of Science from New York University in physical education under the GI Bill, with the government’s financial support, with the intention of using that cover to become a Nazi hunter but never actually worked in that field. Instead, he opened an electronics business and got married. He remained religiously observant and raised his two children to be “part of the Jewish world.” He sought to live in Jewish neighborhoods and relates that before moving into a community on Long Island he checked the houses to see if they had Hanukah candles in the windows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul was hired by Jewish organizations to speak about his experiences as part of their fundraising. He helped start American Veterans of Israel (known as Mahal, an acronym for Mitnadvei Hutz La’aretz, in Hebrew) and supports the Lone Soldier program in Israel. In 1994 he helped launch a program in which young people traveling to Israel can re-enact the Exodus experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul had thought that Yiddish would die out and appreciates the efforts of Aaron Lansky, president and founder of the Yiddish Book Center, and the Center itself to preserve and expand the language. He repeatedly stresses the importance of Yiddish as the basis of Yiddishkeit, Jewishness, and “the foundation of our being.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Paul Kaye, Navy veteran and officer on the Haganah ship Hatikvah, was interviewed by Hillary Ossip on July 28, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.Paul begins by describing his family background.

He repeatedly stresses the importance of Yiddish as the basis of Yiddishkeit, Jewishness, and “the foundation of our being.”</teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2011-07-28</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>PaulKaye28july2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/PaulKaye28july2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>United States,World War Two,Immigration, Migration,Yiddish language,Yiddish speaker,Jewish education,Religion and ritual,Jewish Identity,Childhood,Education,Transmission,Urban,Israel,Food and culinary traditions,Yiddish Book Center,Favorite Yiddish word, Yiddish words,Family history, stories about ancestors,Hebrew,Career and Professional Life,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Paul Kaye, New York City, Navy, 1940s, 1990s, Long Island, Queens NY, Temple Hillel Long Island, Haganah, Bronx, Bar Mitzvah, Hatikvah (ship), Cyprus, UJA Federation, American Veterans of Israel,</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Paul Kaye</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Paul</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Kaye</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1967</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Manhattan, NY</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>1527</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrQhbsktLLw</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5493</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/bar-mitzvah-at-age-twelve</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1528</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xVwnBvoo5Q</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5532</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/delicacies-kosher-home</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1529</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477_qdSriUg</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5531</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/i-spoke-both-languages-always</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1530</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWs0dBv6ASg</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5530</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/im-joining-navy-paul-come</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1531</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNVywXQMk4E</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5522</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/would-you-like-help-your-people</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1532</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hHZRM3LKck</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5529</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/sailing-towards-palestine</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1533</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrFfO05_owY</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5528</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/thats-when-yiddish-saved-my-life</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1534</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcglxeoyvG0</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5526</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/blowing-up-prison-ship</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1535</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1536</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8mP0ZGs0xg</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5527</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/paddy-fitzgerald-saved-my-life</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1537</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxs7OJYfi0</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5525</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/i-looked-khanike-channukah-candles-window-buying-my-first-house</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1538</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtb1zsaZPTo</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5523</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/yiddish-picks-up-language-country</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>1539</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nwkARyO284</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>5524</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/word-davka</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>173</interview_id><interview_abstract>Hilary Salk, activist and author, was interviewed by Jayne Pearl on October 10, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hilary was born in 1942, just days after her maternal grandfather died.

Both of his parents fled Europe at the time of World War Two. Sruli tells of his father’s early childhood as part of the only visibly Hasidic family in Charleroi, Belgium, where his grandparents owned a kosher grocery. Sruli’s paternal grandparents were part of a group of refugees that Eleanor Roosevelt brought to Oswego, New York. Sruli then moves on to discuss his mother’s family. He explains how they came from a town called Sanuk, also known as Sonik, in the region known as Galicia, though they had been living in Berlin. They fled Germany after Kristallnacht and his mother was born in Cuba in 1940 before the family completed their journey to New York.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sruli then moves on to discuss his childhood and family. He refers to his childhood as one infused with Jewish music from his paternal and maternal grandfathers. He explains that from them he learned the songs traditionally sung around the Shabbos (Sabbath) table. He describes his maternal grandfather as a “collector of nigunim” or wordless melodies, noting how he would ask visitors to “teach me [him] a new nign from Poland.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sruli describes growing up in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York, which in 1961 had only a small Hasidic community. Because of this characteristic, the neighborhood synagogue he attended attracted a mix of people, not only those sharing one place of origin. In Sruli’s words, this was a great benefit because it resulted in his exposure to a variety of melodies from different parts of the Jewish world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although he found himself questioning his religiosity, Sruli explains how after high school he immersed himself in further religious study, He then relates how he made the choice to give up religious observance, opting to “enter the real world,” at the age of twenty-four.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the Jewish melodies Sruli knows from childhood are associated with a specific person or holiday. As an example, he sings a Galician march that he learned from his maternal uncle Chaim. Sruli makes a connection between the emotion present in Jewish music and in religious expression, especially on Shabbos, explaining how even after he left religious practice, the music remained a source of connection. “It took hold of me,” he says.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As parents of young children, Sruli describes how he and his partner have made several recordings of children’s music. In their performances and recordings they try to communicate the excitement of the music to young people. The duo bring authentic Jewish music into schools with engaging programs using singing, stories, and dancing adapted to the school environment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toward the end of the interview, Sruli reflects on his love of Yiddish and Klezmer, nothing that both are ways of “making friends with the culture.” He describes what makes a really good nign, noting that the good nigunim have a focal point: “they are not cliché or trite; the good ones hammer a note and the repetition really allows for a meditative quality. They have something that really grabs you.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sruli ends the interview discussing the role of music in transmitting culture to future generations. He views his role as important: “to leave kids with a lingering positive association with the music, and to make it interesting, lively and cool.” He explains that he sees himself helping to preserve a culture that has great value and offers this advice: “Don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater; music will enrich your life.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Sruli Dresdner, Jewish musician, scholar, and educator, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on August 25, 2011 at KlezKanada, in Montreal, Quebec. Sruli begins with a discussion of his family origins.

music will enrich your life.” </teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish and the Performing Artists: musicians, actors, and artists;Yiddish and the Arts: musicians, actors, and artists</interview_interview_series><interview_location>KlezKanada</interview_location><interview_date>2011-08-25</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>SruliDresdner25august2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/SruliDresdner25august2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Holocaust,Roots/heritage,Music,Advice,Family history and stories re. ancestors,Childhood,Yiddish language (feelings of/about, meaning, descriptions of),Career and Professional Life,Religion and ritual,Jewish holidays,Eastern Europe,Western Europe,United States,Yiddish Book Center,Transmission (intergenerational, cultural, social... parenting),Jewish community (descriptions of place and social dynamics in a particular time),</themes><uncontroled_themes>Chasidic, Belgium, Romania, Galicia, Eleanor Roosevelt, Kristallnacht, Cuba, wedding cake, Satmar, hoysbokher, nigunim, Queens, 1961, Satmar, Belgium, Chasidism, Galicia, Cuba, Sanok stetl, hoysbokher, nigunim, Kew Gardens Queens, Klezmer, Klezkanada, klezkamp, Paul Pincus</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Sruli Dresdner</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Sruli</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Dresdner</narrator_last_name></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>530</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWEpcbyVNjo </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2917</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/my-illustrious-family</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>531</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbeeb_aYSkA </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2913</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/they-didnt-hit-us-too-much-kheder</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>532</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spbTH9u2d2k </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2547</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/singing-a-nign-from-his-childhood</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>533</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>534</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH62GTQa5jA </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2908</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/i-stopped-being-a-corporate-lawyer-and-devoted-my-life-yiddish-music</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>535</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUGyluTZ-5s </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2915</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/thats-best-song-i-ever-heard</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>536</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1aNBe_ngWg </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2909</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/love-language</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>537</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sa6_iMUWyg </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2916</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/telling-secrets-front-kids</drupal6_url><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>538</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZjud40ztUc </excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>2914</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/what-makes-a-good-nign</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>195</interview_id><interview_abstract>Abraham (Ingue) Kanzepolsky, born in the Jewish Agricultural Colony of Moisesville in Argentina, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on May 23, 2011 in Moisesville, Argentina.</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Abraham (Ingue) Kanzepolsky, born in the Jewish Agricultural Colony of Moisesville in Argentina, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on May 23, 2011 in Moisesville, Argentina.</teaser_text><interview_location>Moisesville, Argentina</interview_location><interview_date>2011-05-23</interview_date><interview_language>Yiddish &amp;

Having left Europe after the borders to the United States were closed to Eastern European immigration, her parents settled in Canada and waited to be allowed into the goldene medine (the “Golden Land”). Alice begins the interview by describing her childhood in Windsor. She explains that her family was poor, but that education was highly prized, and recalls often hearing Yiddish as a child at community gatherings.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice describes the food of her childhood in detail. She discusses the latkes her mother made on Chanukah, the chopped liver and chicken soup the family often had on Shabbos, and the selling of khometz (leavened foods that are forbidden during Passover) before the holiday started. She remembers the sponge cake her mother baked every day of Passover because she and her sister would eat an entire sponge cake each day.  She also recalls the live carp that her mother would keep in the bathtub on Fridays because her father refused to eat any fish he had not seen alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice also discusses her elementary school and childhood friends, explaining that she lived on a block with Jewish and Catholic families, but that her school was primarily Jewish and Protestant.  The I.L. Peretz School she attended after elementary school five days a week (Mondays through Thursdays and Sunday mornings) was a pivotal part of Alice’s childhood and where she became excited about Yiddish.  She remembers learning Yiddish songs – and sings one about hamentaschen (triangular cookies made for the holiday of Purim) in the interview – and also recalls Yiddish plays that the school put on.  She explains that the Peretz School was a huge influence in her life, bequeathing her with a life-long love of Yiddish language and culture, as well as a political view that stresses social justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the early summer of 1946, Alice and her family moved from Ontario across the river to Detroit, Michigan.  Detroit, Alice explains, was a shock to her.  Having grown up in the safe environment of Windsor, Detroit seemed like a big city where the children were much more sophisticated.  The transition to America was not easy for the family, especially as they had no place to live when they first arrived, splitting up and staying with various family members.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an adult, Alice has been very involved with various Jewish communities.  While living in Illinois she became a Bat Mitzvah, participating in an adult B’nai Mitzvah class.  For Alice, becoming a Bat Mitzvah was her declaration as a Jew.  Alice explains that she has been active in synagogues for much of her adult life.  When she moved to Tennessee, she was amazed to find an incredibly lively Jewish community.  She now is on the board of the Judaica Museum and also volunteers as a docent there.  Furthermore, she works with the floral foundation and the Mother Bear Project, knitting bears for children with AIDS in Africa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout her life, Alice explains, Yiddish has been central to her identity.  She recalls the Yiddish movies and plays she saw as a child, as well as listening to her father read out loud the “Bintel Brief” column from The Forward newspaper on Sunday afternoons.  Although Alice (and both of her daughters) married non-Jews, Judaism remains a key part of her identity, and, Alice believes, of her daughters’ identities.  She has celebrated Jewish holidays with her family throughout her adult life, and her daughters continue to do the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice ends the interview by stating that Yiddish is not a dead or dying language, and remarks that the Yiddish Book Center is “resuscitating” the language.  She believes that Yiddish is in a revival period, explaining that there has even been a Yiddish reading group in Memphis, Tennessee.  She then encourages everyone to join the Yiddish Book Center and advises the next generation to learn about the art, culture, and heritage of Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Alice Ahart, a retired speech language pathologist, was interviewed by Allie Brudney on November 17, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.Alice Ahart grew up in Windsor, Ontario, right across the border from Detroit, where her mother’s extended family lived.

Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Gonshor begins the interview discussing her family background. She was born in 1949 in Paris, France, and in 1950 her family immigrated to Montreal, where she grew up.

Professor Gonshor talks about her parents’ secular Judaism, and her father’s insistence on one knowing one’s roots and traditions are before choosing to reject them. In spite of her family’s lack of religious feeling, they were deeply committed to Jewish cultural existence, and she describes their Friday night table as “the most Shabbosdik place” she has ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Gonshor talks about how she ended up teaching Yiddish in spite of her training as a librarian, and describes her passion for educating young people about their culture and history.

She talks about what her students connect to when they learn Yiddish, and what they discover besides language. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Gonshor also discusses her very active role in Montreal’s Jewish community – from past work as President of the JPL and chair of the Montreal Committee for Soviet Jewry, to present work with Montreal’s Federation Combined Jewish Appeal – and describes how her upbringing gave her a sense of love and commitment to the Jewish community. She talks about her long connection to the Jewish Public Library, and the institution’s central role in Montreal’s Jewish community.

He was born in Poland after WWII and his family immigrated to Montreal in 1948 after Canada’s immigration policy became more liberal. Aron goes on to describe growing up in Montreal’s flourishing Yiddish-speaking community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He explains how his parents were members of the Bund, which met at the Montreal branch of the Workmen’s Circle. He also describes how he grew up attending afternoon school there, at the Avrom Reisen Shul. He recalls how the Workmen’s Circle became a home, and the community there became family, for many survivors of the war. Aron explains how Bund meetings, lectures and concerts in Yiddish allowed survivors to live out their lives in a way they were used to, and created a very full, animated atmosphere. For Aron, being enveloped in this environment from childhood, speaking and performing in Yiddish was “as simple as breathing the air.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aron also discusses his involvement with Yiddish theatre. He describes the early days of Yiddish theatre in Montreal when Soviet-trained actress Dora Wasserman began to give theatre classes to youths at the Jewish Public Library, and traces the theatre’s development over time. He shares a particular story about traveling to Vienna with the theatre company to perform in Yiddish there and giving a particularly emotional performance of The Dybbuk. He reflects on that visit to Austria and notes that it gave the whole theatre company the understanding that they have a responsibility, as Yiddish speakers, to preserve the legacy of Jewish culture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of the interview, Aron urges the importance of one knowing one’s history, and speaks about the fulfillment of conveying that history to others so that the next generations can build on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Aron Gonshor, actor in the Montreal Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre and surgeon, was interviewed by Sara Israel on December 15, 2011 at the Montreal Jewish Public Library in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Aron starts the interview by discussing his family background.

For Aron, being enveloped in this environment from childhood, speaking and performing in Yiddish was “as simple as breathing the air.” Aron also discusses his involvement with Yiddish theatre. He describes the early days of Yiddish theatre in Montreal when Soviet-trained actress Dora Wasserman began to give theatre classes to youths at the Jewish Public Library, and traces the theatre’s development over time. He shares a particular story about traveling to Vienna with the theatre company to perform in Yiddish there and giving a particularly emotional performance of The Dybbuk. He reflects on that visit to Austria and notes that it gave the whole theatre company the understanding that they have a responsibility, as Yiddish speakers, to preserve the legacy of Jewish culture. Towards the end of the interview, Aron urges the importance of one knowing one’s history, and speaks about the fulfillment of conveying that history to others so that the next generations can build on it.</teaser_text><interview_interview_series>Yiddish and the Performing Artists: musicians, actors, and artists;Yiddish and the Arts: musicians, actors, and

Friedmann, professor emeritus of Interior Design at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, was interviewed by Allie Brudney on November 8, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Friedmann begins the talking about his family background. Born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1925 into a bourgeois German-Jewish family, he describes his parents as solid middle-class. Professor Friedmann discusses attending Gymnasium (high school) in Nuremberg and tells a particular story of how the students would sing the Horst Wessel song every morning at school during assembly. He also describes how in 1936 he was forbidden to attend the “German” school and forced to attend a Jewish school in a small town outside of Nuremberg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Friedmann explains that although his family was “totally assimilated,” he regularly attended a reform synagogue with his mother primarily for social reasons. Professor Friedmann describes the night of November 9th, 1938, the night of Kristallnacht (the night on which large-scale, anti-Jewish pogroms were launched against Jews throughout Germany, annexed Austria, and other Nazi-occupied territories), which prompted his family to leave Germany for Palestine in 1938. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Describing life in Palestine as initially difficult, Professor Friedmann tells the story of how he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker at the age of thirteen. Despite the “primitive” lifestyle in Palestine, he goes on to talk about his relatively happy youth and reflects on the close-knit group of friends he made. He also discusses joining the British military at the age of eighteen and meeting his best friend, Jacob. After being discharged, he moved to New York to attend design school at the Pratt Institute. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Friedmann describes studying in New York at the Pratt Institute, where after the end of the War for Israeli Independence, he received his MA in art and interior design and taught for a number of years. He also discusses his move to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1972 where he helped found an interior design program. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reflecting on his connections to and study of Yiddish, Professor Friedmann goes on to talk about his first interests in and engagement with Yiddish. He describes how he first became fascinated by Yiddish while living in New York in the late 1940s and renting a room from a highly educated Yiddish-speaking woman. He recalls thinking that this woman and her friends knew so much more than his parents’ acquaintances, who as German Jews, had thought they knew everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Friedmann also reflects on his relationship to Germany in the aftermath of the Holocaust and describes how for thirty years he refused to speak German or buy German products. He discusses how since the 1970s he began to view Germans in a different light than those of his own generation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of the interview, Professor Friedmann discusses his Jewish identity and what that means in an American context. For him, being a good Jew and a good American are intricately connected. He notes that America allows Jews to be both American and Jewish – something that after growing up in Nazi Germany he does not take for granted. He also explains the unintended consequence of how the anti-Semitism in 1930s Germany formed him into a culturally proud Jew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professor Friedmann ends the interview by reflecting on his love of Yiddish literature and explains that he often uses Yiddish words when teaching. He also admits that he is a little bit jealous of those who grew up speaking Yiddish. He concludes by describing his hope that in the future there will be fewer differences between people of different races and no more wars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Arnold Friedmann, professor emeritus of Interior Design at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, was interviewed by Allie Brudney on November 8, 2011 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts. Professor Friedmann begins the talking about his family background.

He also discusses his move to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1972 where he helped found an interior design program. Reflecting on his connections to and study of Yiddish, Professor Friedmann goes on to talk about his first interests in and engagement with Yiddish. He describes how he first became fascinated by Yiddish while living in New York in the late 1940s and renting a room from a highly educated Yiddish-speaking woman. He recalls thinking that this woman and her friends knew so much more than his parents’ acquaintances, who as German Jews, had thought they knew everything.Professor Friedmann also reflects on his relationship to Germany in the aftermath of the Holocaust and describes how for thirty years he refused to speak German or buy German products. He discusses how since the 1970s he began to view Germans in a different light than those of his own generation. Towards the end of the interview, Professor Friedmann discusses his Jewish identity and what that means in an American context. For him, being a good Jew and a good American are intricately connected. He notes that America allows Jews to be both American and Jewish – something that after growing up in Nazi Germany he does not take for granted. He also explains the unintended consequence of how the anti-Semitism in 1930s Germany formed him into a culturally proud Jew.Professor Friedmann ends the interview by reflecting on his love of Yiddish literature and explains that he often uses Yiddish words when teaching. He also admits that he is a little bit jealous of those who grew up speaking Yiddish. He concludes by describing his hope that in the future there will be fewer differences between people of different races and no more wars. </teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2011-11-08</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>ArnoldFreidman08nov2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/ArnoldFreidman08nov2011YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Advice,Favorite Yiddish word, Yiddish words,Family history, stories about ancestors,Childhood,Jewish Identity,Yiddish language,Yiddish learning,Yiddish revival and activism,Immigration, Migration,Other languages,Visual Arts,Literature,Books,Career and Professional Life,World War Two,Holocaust,Education,Religion and ritual,Family traditions,Jewish holidays,Israel,Zionism,Western Europe,United States,Politics and political movements,Youth group,Food and culinary traditions,Transmission,Roots/heritage,Anti-Semitism,Jewish community,Urban,Assimilation,Travel,Yiddish Book Center,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Arnold Friedmann, Nuremberg, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Palestine, Egypt, Fuerth, New York City, Amherst MA, Freiburg, Finland, Henry Kissinger, Sholem Aleichem, I.B.

Her paternal grandparents were born in Memphis, Tennessee. Her paternal grandfather’s parents were from Kiev, Ukraine, and her paternal grandmother’s parents came from Ponevezh and Posvol, Lithuania. Her maternal grandparents were both from Liepzig, Germany and arrived in the United States between 1937 and 1938. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare lived in Memphis until she was thirteen and from there lived in many places, including Nashville, Providence, Germany, and Boston. She currently resides in Brooklyn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare recalls how the family would have Shabbos dinner at her paternal grandparent’s house in Tennessee that consisted of chicken noodle soup, fried chicken or brisket, and a rice kugel. Her grandfather would recite Hebrew prayers in his southern twang. The family belonged to a conservative synagogue until they transitioned to a reform congregation after her Israeli Bat Mitzvah and the passing of her grandfather. She describes the noticeable difference between the Jewish observances in the South and the Northeast. In Clare’s experience, “Conservative” in the South is “much more Orthodox” in the Northeast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare discusses her exploration of Jewish identity which began when she started practicing Jewish music with her violin teacher. Clare reflects on her time at the Yiddish Book Center as a summer intern and recognizes that her English speaking household had Yiddish influences from her maternal grandmother even though her grandmother was raised to assimilate in Germany and become “a quintessential German girl.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare talks about her time at Brown University where she studied German and German history. She also studied Klezmer and Yiddishkeit (Jewish culture and history) for a year abroad in Hamburg, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Munich. She also discusses her time at KlezKamp, an annual Klezmer and Yiddish cultural festival held in New York, and her work at the Yiddish Book Center where she began songwriting. Reflecting on her time in Amherst, Clare notes, “I found a piece of myself around fairly likeminded people who were exploring the same sorts of things.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare applied for a Fulbright scholarship, travelled back to Cologne, and understood that she wanted to explore her identity through music. She was accepted to the first round of The Six Points Fellowship for Jewish artists to “find out what the relationship was between my Jewish culture and identity, and the music I was creating.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She then discusses the origins of her album, “Silver and Ash.” It synthesized from a trunk that contained “an object, the size of my hand, crumpled in aluminum foil… that look(ed) like a pumice stone,” an artifact she was given by her paternal grandmother when she visited during Passover. She recalls a story her grandmother told her about this cheese wedge traveling in her great-grandfather’s possession when he was fourteen. It travelled from 1893 from the shtetl (village) in Lithuania, to South Africa, through the Boer Wars where he fought with the Dutch, to Leeds, England, and on to its final resting place in Memphis, Tennessee. The majority of her songs were influenced by her grandmother's life prior to her arrival in the United States and Clare’s relationship with her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She explains that she is still examining Jewish identity and Yiddish culture in her work with artist peers, but is not keeping up with her Yiddish studies. Clare sees many people her age looking into the culture because “there is something more compelling about the stories that took place involving characters…that died long before you were around in places that you'll never know and in eras that you'll never know.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time of the interview, she is pregnant with her first child and intends on raising the child in a Jewish household and making Yiddish, folklore tunes such as “Di Mashke (Whiskey)” and fried chicken Shabbos dinners a tradition for their family.

His father, a Yiddish speaker and a Bolshevik, was from Podolia and his family was more oriented toward Russia and Russian. Conversely, his mother came from an Orthodox family from a small shtetl (village) near Skala in Poland. His maternal grandfather taught the children in the shtetl. Arnold shares a particular story about his relative, Isaac Metzker, Yiddish novelist and short story writer born in Poland in 1901, who published “A Bintel Brief: Sixty Years of Letters from the Lower East Side to the Jewish Daily Forward” in English translation in 1971. He notes that the picture on the cover of the 1971 edition is his mother as a young girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Describing his neighborhood as the place where “the Italian kids beat up the Jewish kids,” Arnold then talks about living in Boro Park, Brooklyn. His grandmother, a native Yiddish speaker, lived with him until she died. Arnold explains that he learned Yiddish from her and grew up speaking both English and Yiddish. He shares a particular memory of reading a headline from the Jewish Daily Forward announcing the death of Freud when he was a child.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arnold then moves on to discuss his education, Yiddish in his home, and what his family knew about the Holocaust. He attended a Yiddishe Shule run by the Arbeter Ring or Workmen’s Circle from 1941-1946 and describes the Shule as the only place where he really spoke Yiddish with other young people because although Yiddish was spoken in the home, he didn’t grow up in a heavy Yiddish atmosphere. He also recalls how at home his family had Sholem Aleichem and Peretz and other Yiddish books as well as the Jewish Daily Forward.  Arnold reflects on how the Holocaust was very much a part of his childhood experience because his family had relatives in Europe and his parents read the Yiddish newspaper so they were aware of what was going on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arnold also discusses religiosity in his family and explains that his father was an atheist who went to the movies on Yom Kippur while his mother was Orthodox but just kept kosher. He further reflects on what he calls his Jewish-Yiddish identity and describes being comfortable with being an American and a Jew. He then reflects on his journey back to Yiddish upon returning to New York City after studying and later joining the Society for Advancement of Judaism. Arnold recalls a particular memory of getting Ida Kaminska, the famed Polish-Jewish actress, to perform and raised money for her at the ASJ. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussing his involvement in the Yiddish scene in New York, Arnold reflects on being on the board of YIVO and the founding of the Center for Jewish History on West 16th Street where YIVO is currently housed. He views his interests in Jewish culture and psychiatry as intersecting together in his life and work. In particular, Arnold is interested in psychoanalysis and Yiddish and is very fascinated by the life of Freud and his relationship to his Jewish identity. Reflecting on his connection to Yiddish, he notes: “My interest redt zikh, it speaks itself.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of the interview, Arnold reflects on today’s generation of young Jews with respect to their identities and Yiddish. Arnold sees a disconnect between his generation and today’s generation in terms of Yiddish, i.e., growing up in a bilingual household where Yiddish was spoken. However, he speaks fondly about younger Jews coming back to their family past and interacting with Yiddish and sees it as the task for today’s generation to immerse themselves in Yiddish so that it won’t disappear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arnold ends the interview advising young people to continue to strengthen the legacy of Yiddish and is adamant that Yiddish is not a dead language: “Shakespeare is still around.

Alperowitch, co-president of the Lithuanian Jewish Community, was interviewed  by Christa Whitney on July 31, 2012 in Vilnius, Lithuania. This interview is entirely in Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon Alperowitch was born in Vilna (Vilnius) in 1928, during the Polish occupation of Lita.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His mother came from a prominent Jewish family in Lita (Lithuania) called Strashun. Some of Shimon's ancestors were renowned rabbis, mentioned in the German Jewish encyclopedia, Brockhaus. There is a library named after the Strashun family in Vilna. His father's family, the Alperowitches, came from a shtetl (village) near Vilna, called Kurenets. Shimon can trace his family back to 1790.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon says his father was unhappy under Polish rule and took his family to Kovno. Shimon lived there until 1941. He went to a Yiddish-language Sholem Aleychem school. It was a secular, Leftist environment. Shimon remembers that his teachers as being very good. The school director was Levin, and the teachers he mentions were Rosenthal, Koliantshik and Tsorfas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At home Shimon spoke Polish, Russian and Yiddish with his parents, who had studied in Russian schools. His father was an atheist, and they did not lead a religious life, despite the family yiches (heritage). His father worked as an engineer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon recalls that Kovno had quite a large Jewish population, a Jewish quarter with Jewish shops, a Jewish intelligentsia, and four Jewish schools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon speaks about his family, who were annihilated in the Holocaust by Germans and Lithuanian nationalists. His aunts and grandparents were shot in Ponar. Shimon sees this as the greatest tragedy of Lita's Jews: that there was not one family that did not suffer a loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon recalls his grandparents, especially the Strashuns, with whom he was close. His grandfather, Michael Strashun, was a gabai (synagogue administrator), religious, and knew several languages. Shimon learned to play chess from him. His grandmother, Bertha Shilevitch, lived with them until she died in 1940.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon his family’s fleeing Kovno when Germany invaded. They boarded a train (echelon) to Vilna, but Vilna was under bombardment: they went on to Penza, 1600 kilometers east, in Russia. After the war they returned to Vilna, which was devastated, most of its Jews having perished. But others came that had survived in the Soviet Union. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon states that his Jewish identity was never in question, and that he was always proud to be a Jew. At home they spoke Russian during Soviet times, but Jewish themes were often topics of conversation. Shimon emphasizes that in Lita, as opposed to other Soviet republics, Jews often spoke Yiddish. Hebrew was forbidden, and cause for arrest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon also explains why he didn't immigrate to Israel: he feels that it is important to maintain the Jewish community in Vilna. In Israel, he feels, he would just be a pensioner without any real occupation. But he emphasizes that he has very good relations with the Israeli embassy in Vilna, and many friends in Israel with whom he maintains a friendship. The local community also supports Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continuing to describe Vilna during Soviet times, Shimon lists the Jewish cultural entities that were allowed to exist. There were no Jewish schools, but there was a Yiddish folk theater, a Yiddish choir, and a synagogue which held services on Yom Kippur and other holidays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon enumerates the activities of the kehila (community) today: their main aim is to preserve Yiddishkeit (Jewish life). They organize camps for children, and Jewish concerts- there is an ensemble called Feierlach which performs in Yiddish. They attempted to organize three political and cultural congresses of former Litvak performers. There is a Jewish school and kindergarten, financed by the government. Another important activity of the community is fighting anti-Semitic propaganda in the media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caring for the elderly is one of the main functions of the community, and they are greatly aided by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in this venture. There are also many clubs which organize social activities for the elderly Jews living in Vilna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the question of Yiddish in Vilna today, Shimon elaborates on the Yiddish institute which brings foreigners to study Yiddish; Yiddish courses which are given by local teachers; films on local Jewish history are shown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon discusses young people in Vilna today: one of the directors of the community speaks Yiddish with his children and parents, and there is a young woman who became enthusiastic after participating in a program in Israel. In general Shimon is optimistic about the survival of Jewish life in Lita.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon wants to pass on to youth a positive view of their Jewish identity, and the desire to learn more about Jewish literature and culture. He likes to read works by Litvak writers- Sholem Aleichem, Grade, and Sutzkever (whom he knew personally).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shimon hopes the Yiddish language will survive into the future.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Shimon Alperowitch, co-president of the Lithuanian Jewish Community, was interviewed  by Christa Whitney on July 31, 2012 in Vilnius, Lithuania.

His father's family, the Alperowitches, came from a shtetl (village) near Vilna, called Kurenets. Shimon can trace his family back to 1790.Shimon says his father was unhappy under Polish rule and took his family to Kovno. Shimon lived there until 1941. He went to a Yiddish-language Sholem Aleychem school. It was a secular, Leftist environment. Shimon remembers that his teachers as being very good. The school director was Levin, and the teachers he mentions were Rosenthal, Koliantshik and Tsorfas.At home Shimon spoke Polish, Russian and Yiddish with his parents, who had studied in Russian schools. His father was an atheist, and they did not lead a religious life, despite the family yiches (heritage). His father worked as an engineer.Shimon recalls that Kovno had quite a large Jewish population, a Jewish quarter with Jewish shops, a Jewish intelligentsia, and four Jewish schools.Shimon speaks about his family, who were annihilated in the Holocaust by Germans and Lithuanian nationalists. His aunts and grandparents were shot in Ponar. Shimon sees this as the greatest tragedy of Lita's Jews: that there was not one family that did not suffer a loss.Shimon recalls his grandparents, especially the Strashuns, with whom he was close. His grandfather, Michael Strashun, was a gabai (synagogue administrator), religious, and knew several languages. Shimon learned to play chess from him. His grandmother, Bertha Shilevitch, lived with them until she died in 1940.Shimon his family’s fleeing Kovno when Germany invaded. They boarded a train (echelon) to Vilna, but Vilna was under bombardment: they went on to Penza, 1600 kilometers east, in Russia. After the war they returned to Vilna, which was devastated, most of its Jews having perished. But others came that had survived in the Soviet Union. Shimon states that his Jewish identity was never in question, and that he was always proud to be a Jew. At home they spoke Russian during Soviet times, but Jewish themes were often topics of conversation. Shimon emphasizes that in Lita, as opposed to other Soviet republics, Jews often spoke Yiddish. Hebrew was forbidden, and cause for arrest.Shimon also explains why he didn't immigrate to Israel: he feels that it is important to maintain the Jewish community in Vilna. In Israel, he feels, he would just be a pensioner without any real occupation. But he emphasizes that he has very good relations with the Israeli embassy in Vilna, and many friends in Israel with whom he maintains a friendship. The local community also supports Israel.Continuing to describe Vilna during Soviet times, Shimon lists the Jewish cultural entities that were allowed to exist. There were no Jewish schools, but there was a Yiddish folk theater, a Yiddish choir, and a synagogue which held services on Yom Kippur and other holidays.Shimon enumerates the activities of the kehila (community) today: their main aim is to preserve Yiddishkeit (Jewish life). They organize camps for children, and Jewish concerts- there is an ensemble called Feierlach which performs in Yiddish. They attempted to organize three political and cultural congresses of former Litvak performers. There is a Jewish school and kindergarten, financed by the government. Another important activity of the community is fighting anti-Semitic propaganda in the media.Caring for the elderly is one of the main functions of the community, and they are greatly aided by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in this venture. There are also many clubs which organize social activities for the elderly Jews living in Vilna.On the question of Yiddish in Vilna today, Shimon elaborates on the Yiddish institute which brings foreigners to study Yiddish; Yiddish courses which are given by local teachers; films on local Jewish history are shown. Shimon discusses young people in Vilna today: one of the directors of the community speaks Yiddish with his children and parents, and there is a young woman who became enthusiastic after participating in a program in Israel. In general Shimon is optimistic about the survival of Jewish life in Lita.Shimon wants to pass on to youth a positive view of their Jewish identity, and the desire to learn more about Jewish literature and culture. He likes to read works by Litvak writers- Sholem Aleichem, Grade, and Sutzkever (whom he knew personally).Shimon hopes the Yiddish language will survive into the future.</teaser_text><interview_location>Vilnius JCC, Vilnius, Lithuania</interview_location><interview_date>2012-07-31</interview_date><interview_language>Yiddish</interview_language><ia_identifier>ShimonAlperovitch31july2012YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/ShimonAlperovitch31july2012YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Childhood,Family history, stories about ancestors,Yiddish language,Other languages,Eastern Europe,Jewish education,Holocaust,Jewish Identity,Yiddish speaker,Hebrew,Theater,Literature,Jewish community,World War Two,Soviet Union,Transmission,Anti-Semitism,Urban,Synagogue, shul, temple,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Shimon Alperovitch, Lithuania, Vilnius, Vilna, Vilne,Kovno, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Strashun Library, Yiddish Folks Theater, Lithuania Culture Congress, Sholem Aleichem School, Sholem Aleichem, Chaim Grade, Avrom Sutzkever, Abraham Sutzkever, Lithuanian Jewish Community,</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Shimon Alperovitch</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Shimon</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Alperovitch</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1928</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Vilna</narrator_place_of_birth><narrator_deceased>Deceased</narrator_deceased></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>2362</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Klih30_eE&amp;feature=youtu.be</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>8462</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/jewish-vilna-after-world-war-two</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2363</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1EAEkeacmE&amp;feature=youtu.be</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>8461</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/yiddish-culture-soviet-vilna-0</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2364</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705zldWRAGY&amp;feature=youtu.be</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>8460</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/todays-litvak-jewish-community-lithuania</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2365</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVOdz62-68&amp;feature=youtu.be</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>8459</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/late-president-lithuanian-jewish-community-modern-jewish-lithuanian-relations</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>329</interview_id><interview_abstract>Abraham Lichtenbaum, Yiddish teacher and director of the IWO (the Argentinian YIVO, Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut, Yiddish Scientific Institute) in Buenos Aires, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on July 31, 2012 in Vilnius, Lithuania. This interview is entirely in Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham was born in Argentina in 1943. His father came from Warsaw to Buenos Aires as an orphan in 1922. His mother came from Odessa with her family in 1907 or 1908. His maternal family was originally from Slutzk, Belarus, and they were well-to-do merchants. His grandfather studied medicine and was very modern (he played the violin and smoked on the Sabbath). Abraham knew only his grandmother, from whom he learned Yiddish. (His grandfather had died before he was born.) He also spoke Yiddish to his father, but spoke Spanish to his mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham grew up in a very Jewish environment. He attended a Peretz Bund School (a school with secular and socialist orientations and instruction in Yiddish), and lived in a Jewish neighborhood where most of the shops were owned by Jews. Jewish writers and playwrights visited and performed in Buenos Aires, and Abraham went to a Yiddish play almost every Sunday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He describes the ways in which his home was Jewish, too. They celebrated Passover, and on the High Holy Days he accompanied his grandmother to synagogue. She cooked many Jewish dishes, including kreplakh (stuffed dumplings). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham’s father was a socialist, and Abraham inherited his anarchist and socialist books. His father worked in printing and received all the Yiddish books printed in Argentina directly from the authors, with a personal dedication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham also went to a Spanish school in the mornings, and he shares that he preferred the Peretz Bund School, which he attended in the afternoon. They learned about Jewish history, culture, literature, and a considerable amount about World War II, including the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Many of his friends became famous actors and professionals in Buenos Aires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham had many good teachers including Shmuel Rozhansky, a writer and educator, and Shmuel Zessler, a poet. Later on in university he studied with Dov Sadan, Khone Shmeruk, and Dov Noy. At the age of eighteen, when he became a teacher in his childhood Bund school, he used Rozhansky’s Yiddish textbooks. Abraham also taught Hebrew, history, and Torah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham describes how there was a rise in anti-Semitism in the 1960s as a result of the Adolf Eichmann trial. Abraham became the president of the Jewish club in his middle school, which was active in opposing anti-Semitic fellow pupils. Nevertheless, he also had many non-Jewish friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham's first contact with IWO was in sixth grade, in 1955, when he wrote a paper in Yiddish about Jews in Argentina and won first prize in the Cultural Congress competition. IWO was then in the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA, Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building in Buenos Aires. It had an important library, a big hall, many artifacts, works of art (including by Maurycy Minkowski), and records and albums.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The AMIA building was bombed by terrorists in 1994 (which left eighty-seven dead and more than one hundred wounded), and, as a result, IWO moved to the Argentinian Cultural Congress. Abraham, who worked at IWO and was appointed director in 1993, was by chance not in the building at the time of the bombing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham explains that IWO began in Argentina in 1928 in a bookshop; in 1939 they bought a building, which became the Jewish Community Center in 1945.

Her father is from the Philippines and immigrated to the United States when he was around twenty years old during the 1950s. Her mother comes from a Jewish family of Eastern European background with origins in Belarus and Poland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karen then moves on to talk about her experience growing up in a mixed household that moved around the country frequently due to her father’s employment with the United States military. She describes how her home was not very Jewish and how her father wanted her and her siblings to be raised Catholic. Karen recalls celebrating Catholic holidays and receiving a Catholic religious education, adding that it was only when she was older that she became more interested in learning about her Jewish background and involved in Jewish celebrations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Describing her neighborhood as “diverse and often multiethnic,” Karen discusses living in Boston for eight years during the early 1970s and the circumstances surrounding the public school system. Reflecting on her mixed Jewish-Filipino background during the rising tensions in Boston, Karen further explains what it was like being caught between not being black and white, noting: “it made me very sensitive to how people were defined in those circumstances and how they were treated based on the way they got defined.” This experience made her feel an affinity towards different women of color and other groups when she started college. She tells a particular story of how her advisor at Mount Holyoke College took her under her wing and stressed to her that the history of the Philippines is also connected and related to the histories of Latin American and Iberian countries. During her undergraduate years she joined the cultural group, La Unidad, recalling how it was a space where she very much felt like she belonged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Framing her sense of Jewishness through the lens of her mixed background, she notes: “It was something that my family was but didn’t feel like it was something which I was a part of.” She shares a particular reflection on how her interest in Yiddish originates from her grandmother who spoke Yiddish, adding that she knows that Yiddish and Yiddish culture shapes her mother’s family’s sense of self as Jews but can’t quite describe it or why. She then moves on to explain how questions surrounding her Jewishness didn’t surface until she was to be confirmed in the Catholic Church and didn’t want to. She shares a particular anecdote about reading young-adult Holocaust literature when she was a teenager and explains how reading about those experiences allowed her to come to a space where she could understand her Jewishness, and learn about her father’s experiences as a young boy in the Japanese-occupied Philippines during World War Two. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of the interview, Karen reflects on her Jewish identity and states that she doesn’t see herself as a “good Jew” because she doesn’t belong to any community nor is steeply involved in cultural practices. Rather, she sees her connection to Judaism on a deeply personal level: “the way that Judaism affects me most profoundly is thinking about the kind of person I want to and strive to be in the world. Those values affect the way that I interact with people.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She concludes the interview expressing her desire to become proficient in speaking, reading, and writing Yiddish in order to understand more fully the existence of life within the Yiddish language. She is particularly interested in the mission of the Yiddish Book Center’s Wexler Oral History Project to gauge how Yiddish culture and values are transmitted over time and appreciates how it allows for a number of voices and views to be seen and heard. &lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Karen Encarnacion, native of New York City from a mixed Filipino-Jewish family, was interviewed by Agnieszka Ilwicka on October 12, 2012 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.Karen begins the interview discussing her family background, focusing on the multi-cultural and multiethnic nature of her family.

The interview focuses on Anthony's experiences in forming his Jewish identity, his conversion to Judaism, career transformation from opera to Yiddish art song and folk performance, and relationship with the secular Jewish and black communities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony begins by discussing his family’s geographic origins in Fort Worth, Texas. His childhood was spent in Connecticut, Virginia, and Mississippi, but Anthony considers his home to be in San Diego, California where his family settled down. He explains that literacy was incredibly important to his family and recalls how as a child he would often read the novelization of his favorite films. Much like his mother, Anthony is a self-motivated learner and autodidact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony then describes religion’s role in his upbringing. The maternal side of his family was very religious, and Anthony learned from his mother's academic and intellectual rigor that she applied to church choir and Bible study. Reflecting on his upbringing, he notes, "little did I know this would become an asset to me as I would become a Jew." He recalls how his first exposure to Hebrew was with his homeschool group when a peer taught a phrase. Similarly important was when his mother bought him a copy of Fiddler on the Roof, which he watched “religiously.” Anthony expresses surprise that Judaism wasn’t more central to his early education, noting “if you grow up in a Christian surrounding, the connection between [Christianity and Judaism] is not obvious. Maybe that's for reasons of doctrine, or theology.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony discusses the development of his career. He explains how after informal lessons on several instruments, he learned his calling was opera through his exploration and memorization of many notable recordings. Within a year of voice lessons around age seventeen, he had already won a prestigious competition. That experience and his education informed the rest of his professional life. He also talks about the change in his career and about having difficulty finding work as a classically trained opera singer. He explains how after auditioning, he was usually cast as an understudy or chorus member. He describes the epiphany he had to change his professional expectations when he felt like giving up on his dreams after a career of spending more money than he was making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He tells the story of how he met his future husband, Rabbi Michael Rothbaum, in a New York production of Cosi Fan Tutte. With Rothbaum, Anthony dove into studying Judaism, attending synagogue and taking conversion classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony describes how he was struck by the song “Dem Milners Trern (The Miller’s Tears)” when watching the Cohens' film A Serious Man with his husband. Anthony learned it was performed by Paul Robeson and written by Sidor Belarsky. He describes discovering the world of Yiddish art song through his research and studying the entirety of Belarsky's catalog through the Flor Atlantic University Judaic Sound Archive. His first song uploaded to YouTube, “Der Germore Nign,” (sic.) Sidor Belarsky’s arrangement of a Yiddish song, received wide exposure. The following year, Anthony performed at the Sholem Aleichem Cultural Center, the Ashkenaz Festival, and the Moscow Yiddish Music Festival. He recalls receiving feedback and guidance from experts such as Shane Baker, Itzik Gottesman, Benjamin Schecter, and Isabel Belarsky, the daughter of Sidor Belarsky. He concludes by describing his current work curating pairings of Yiddish art song and black spirituals, as well as his collaboration with artists Michael Winograd and Anthony Coleman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony concludes by discussing the challenges he faces in his community by being black and Jewish. He also reflects on the importance of language in his own identity as well as the overall cultural milieu. He notes, “I found Yiddish at a very critical point in my life when I knew that I had feelings and ideas and ways of looking at the world that needed to be expressed. When I was looking for a way to express them, I found Yiddish… [my work is] meant for anyone with two ears and a heart.” &lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Anthony Russell, trained bass opera singer and notable Yiddish art song performer, was interviewed by Christa Whitney on January 9, 2012 at his home in Oakland, California.

Sheldon, retired elementary school teacher and native Yiddish speaker born in Warsaw, Poland, was interviewed by Jessica Parker on March 12, 2013 in Boca Raton, Florida. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna begins the interview discussing her family background. She explains that her mother came from a large prominent, and religious family in Warsaw, Poland. Their surname was Klipfiscz and many members of the family were rabbis; most of the family perished in the Holocaust. On the other hand, she doesn’t know much about her father’s family except that he was the youngest from a large family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She reminisces about her mother whom she describes as “very learned and very ahead of her time,” recalling how her mother spoke eight different languages, knew virtually almost everything about Jewish life and history, and served on many different committees. She also recalls her mother’s emphasis on giving, citing the example of the annual Seder (a Jewish ritual service and ceremonial dinner for the first night or first two nights of Passover) in her family having more than fifty participants despite the family being very small. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna then moves on to discuss her family and childhood. Although she was born in Poland in 1935, Anna was raised in the United States, growing up in New York City before moving to Miami, Florida at the age of nine. Describing her home as “very Jewish,” Anna relates how she, her parents, and grandmother, all spoke Yiddish at home. She tells a particular story of how when she was a young girl she told her mother in Yiddish: “the school children won’t play with me; I don’t understand English!” Anna also discusses attending a Workmen’s Circle Yidishe Shule in New York City and how that was “very normal.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She then moves on to talk about feeling unique among her peers as a Yiddish speaker growing up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Miami where hardly anyone except her family spoke Yiddish. Her parents, whom she describes as liberal and European, are the main reason for her being grounded in Yiddish and being steeped in Yiddishkeit (Jewishness or Jewish way of life). She also discusses the importance of the holidays, Jewish food, and going to shul being an important of her growing up. Anna shares a particularly funny and insightful story of how Rabbi Lerman at Temple Emmanuel, would prostrate himself on the bema (pulpit in a synagogue from where the Torah is read) during the Yom Kippur services. &lt;br&gt;                                                                                    &lt;br&gt;Anna further discusses the impact the Holocaust had on her family and how, following in her mother’s footsteps, she is also very active within the Jewish community of Miami. She shares a particular story of her and her mother encountering a rich Yiddish scene in Toronto in the 1990s when traveling with the National Council of Jewish Women. She also explains how she works with the Holocaust Documentation Center in Miami to teach schoolchildren about the Holocaust and the importance of combating hate and prejudice. For her it is important that her own grandchildren know and be proud of their Jewish heritage and take an active stand against prejudice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toward the end of the interview she reflects on the role of Yiddish in her life and offers advice for future generations of Yiddish learners. For Anna, Yiddish is a significant part of her Jewish identity. She states, “I learned Judaism through Yiddish.” She ends the interview admitting that she doesn’t see a rosy future for Yiddish based on the almost nonexistent presence of Yiddish in Miami, but believes it is important to study Yiddish and encourages younger generations to do so. &lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Anna Sheldon, retired elementary school teacher and native Yiddish speaker born in Warsaw, Poland, was interviewed by Jessica Parker on March 12, 2013 in Boca Raton, Florida. Anna begins the interview discussing her family background. She explains that her mother came from a large prominent, and religious family in Warsaw, Poland. Their surname was Klipfiscz and many members of the family were rabbis; most of the family perished in the Holocaust. On the other hand, she doesn’t know much about her father’s family except that he was the youngest from a large family. She reminisces about her mother whom she describes as “very learned and very ahead of her time,” recalling how her mother spoke eight different languages, knew virtually almost everything about Jewish life and history, and served on many different committees. She also recalls her mother’s emphasis on giving, citing the example of the annual Seder (a Jewish ritual service and ceremonial dinner for the first night or first two nights of Passover) in her family having more than fifty participants despite the family being very small. Anna then moves on to discuss her family and childhood. Although she was born in Poland in 1935, Anna was raised in the United States, growing up in New York City before moving to Miami, Florida at the age of nine. Describing her home as “very Jewish,” Anna relates how she, her parents, and grandmother, all spoke Yiddish at home. She tells a particular story of how when she was a young girl she told her mother in Yiddish: “the school children won’t play with me; I don’t understand English!” Anna also discusses attending a Workmen’s Circle Yidishe Shule in New York City and how that was “very normal.” She then moves on to talk about feeling unique among her peers as a Yiddish speaker growing up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Miami where hardly anyone except her family spoke Yiddish.

Licht Rosenthal, social worker, feminist, and Yiddish enthusiast, was interviewed by Nina Dabek on July 22, 2013 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rita grew up in the Bronx.  Her parents both came to the New York from Galicia: her father from Kalush, Ukraine in 1913, and her mother, the youngest of ten children, from Olesko, Poland sometime after the Immigration Act of 1924. Although her father's two older brothers were both waiters, he sought out other work and was trained to become a furrier.  He was involved with the International Fur Workers Union, and during the 1926 strike he was charged with tracking down scabs.  Her mother was also a fur worker and somehow her name was on his list.  That's how they met.  They married and Rita was born on February 2, 1930.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her father lost his job due to the depression.  They lived in a 4-room apartment on Mapes Ave. in the East Bronx, and her father opened up a little fur business in the second bedroom.  Rita's younger brother was born, and the family moved into a storefront with three tiny rooms in the back on Bathgate Ave.  She particularly loved to spend time in the library, nearby on Washington Avenue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her father felt himself truly an American and felt they must only speak English to their American children.  To each other, however, they spoke Yiddish, and Rita absorbed the language.  Around 1939-40 her parents managed to bring her mother's brother and his wife over from Vienna.  They lived with Rita's family for six months, speaking only Yiddish, and that helped to solidify Rita's knowledge of Yiddish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her mother kept a kosher home, observed many holidays, and regretted that because of the business she couldn't keep Shabbos.  Her father, who could read Hebrew, didn't care. He was secular, a socialist at heart, read Yiddish and English papers and was very Jewish.  Rita's brother was sent to a rabbi to study for his bar mitzvah.  Rita, a feminist her whole life, also wanted to learn.  She heard that Evander Child's High School--not her local school--provided Hebrew classes, so in spite of the long trip via trolley she went attended the school in order to study Hebrew.  She earned the "golden ayin" award in May, 1945, for being at the top of her class.  Her father became sick in July and died in August after an operation for cancer.  Rita's uncle was with him as he died, and his last words were "Hebreish, hebreish (Hebrew, Hebrew), referring to Rita's award--it meant so much to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rita attended college at night, and a year and a half after marrying graduated from City College with a B.S. in education and a minor in psychology (at the time women weren't allowed to matriculate in liberal arts).  She and her husband bought a house on Long Island and were founding members of the Comack Jewish Center.  She also helped start the Center's nursery school, which exists to this day. She raised four children, earned a master's degree in social work from Adelphi University, worked as a social worker, and was active with the Nassau County Women's Center and the National Organization for Women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her children and grandchildren have been involved in religious Jewish life and with Israel. Rita's love of Yiddish is central to her.  She doesn't believe it is a dying language--she has encountered Yiddish speakers on the street in Italy and in France, and she believes everyone should speak Yiddish.  She has supported the Yiddish Book Center since she first heard about it.&lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Rita Licht Rosenthal, social worker, feminist, and Yiddish enthusiast, was interviewed by Nina Dabek on July 22, 2013 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.Rita grew up in the Bronx.

Rita's uncle was with him as he died, and his last words were "Hebreish, hebreish (Hebrew, Hebrew), referring to Rita's award--it meant so much to him.Rita attended college at night, and a year and a half after marrying graduated from City College with a B.S. in education and a minor in psychology (at the time women weren't allowed to matriculate in liberal arts).  She and her husband bought a house on Long Island and were founding members of the Comack Jewish Center.  She also helped start the Center's nursery school, which exists to this day. She raised four children, earned a master's degree in social work from Adelphi University, worked as a social worker, and was active with the Nassau County Women's Center and the National Organization for Women.Her children and grandchildren have been involved in religious Jewish life and with Israel. Rita's love of Yiddish is central to her.  She doesn't believe it is a dying language--she has encountered Yiddish speakers on the street in Italy and in France, and she believes everyone should speak Yiddish.  She has supported the Yiddish Book Center since she first heard about it.</teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center - Amherst, MA USA</interview_location><interview_date>2013-07-22</interview_date><interview_language>English</interview_language><ia_identifier>RitaLichtRosenthal22july2013YiddishBookCenter</ia_identifier><ia_url>https://archive.org/details/RitaLichtRosenthal22july2013YiddishBookCenter</ia_url><themes>Family history, stories about ancestors,Childhood,Jewish Identity,Yiddish language,Holocaust,Education,Religion and ritual,Family traditions,Feminism,Eastern Europe,Transmission,Urban,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Rita Rosenthal, Oleska, Galicia, National Organization for Women, 1930's</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Rita Licht Rosenthal</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Rita</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Licht Rosenthal</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1930</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Bronx, NY</narrator_place_of_birth></narrator><excerpt><excerpt_id>2719</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2720</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2721</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2722</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtaH1iVwatw</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11427</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/life-bathgate-ave-bronx-neighborhood-during-depression</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2723</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Lp2Y4r4xo</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11428</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/three-weeks-same-lesson-tutoring-rebetsn-rabbis-wife</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2724</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2jwZIS25XY</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11429</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/heybreyish-heybreyish-fathers-naches-pride-his-daughters-hebrew-skills</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2725</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOoQeBekdyk</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11430</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/yiddish-venice-and-paris</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2726</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QlWRHhEifg</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11431</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/organizing-jewish-community-wilderness-suffolk-county</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2727</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBaojCaxdwE</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11432</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/same-classes-different-degree-sexism-at-college</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2728</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>2729</excerpt_id><excerpt_ytURL>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPG6fIif_j4</excerpt_ytURL><drupal6_node>11433</drupal6_node><drupal6_url>http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/video/life-service</drupal6_url><uploaded>Yes</uploaded></excerpt><excerpt><excerpt_id>3702</excerpt_id><uploaded>No</uploaded></excerpt></record><record><interview_id>445</interview_id><interview_abstract>Walter Rosenthal, marketing and advertising professional, was interviewed by Lynn Yanis on July 22, 2013 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Walter Rosenthal, marketing and advertising professional, was interviewed by Lynn Yanis on July 22, 2013 at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.</teaser_text><interview_location>Yiddish Book Center -

His father’s father, though born in Mogilev (presently Belarus), moved to Kiev early in his life. He later started a soap factory in that city, and for a time the family prospered. After the factory “went bust,” the grandfather could not make a living in Russia and decided to emigrate to the U.S. Dr. Zumoff’s mother and father were first cousins, so they had the same ancestry.&lt;br&gt;	Dr. Zumoff’s father was seventeen when he came to America. Trained as a carpenter in vocational school, he later became a cutter of shirts and joined the ILGWU (International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union) and the Workmen’s Circle. He then got a job in the composing room of the Yiddish Forward (Forverts) newspaper in 1925. Dr. Zumoff was born in 1926 and grew up in Brooklyn. The family remained relatively well-off even during the Depression.&lt;br&gt;	Dr. Zumoff’s father’s native language was Yiddish. His mother was not fluent but used some expressions. The family celebrated Jewish holidays but was not strongly religious. Dr. Zumoff already understood Yiddish and expanded his knowledge at a Workmen’s Circle school and at Yiddish mitlshul (high school). One of his teachers was Adele Opatoshu, wife of novelist Joseph Opatoshu.&lt;br&gt;	Dr. Zumoff’s father knew many writers, among them Mani Leib and Avrom Reyzen, but he was not a reader. Dr. Zumoff later met the poet Avrom Sutzkever.&lt;br&gt;	Dr. Zumoff attended the Workmen’s Circle summer camp, Camp Kinder Ring. Children there were prohibited to visit the communist-oriented Camp Kinderland. Later, there was rapprochement with former communists, grounded in Yiddish. Dr. Zumoff’s father was involved in an unofficial anti-communist club within Workmen’s Circle. On at least one occasion Dr. Zumoff was able to visit the composing room of the Forward, which he describes.&lt;br&gt;	Somewhat unintentionally, Dr. Zumoff began translating Yiddish literature into English. He began in 1983 by co-translating a play by Sholem Aleichem. His first solo translation was a book of poetry by Sutzkever. He then did a book of Holocaust-themed poetry by Jacob Glatstein. He considers Glatstein and Sutzkever his favorite Yiddish poets, with H. Leivick probably third.&lt;br&gt;	Dr. Zumoff has been an active leader in many Yiddish organizations, notably the Workmen’s Circle and the association that manages the Forward. He had occasion to help Aaron Lansky get started toward founding the Yiddish Book Center.&lt;br&gt;	Through the Workmen’s Circle, Dr. Zumoff developed a close relationship with Yosl and Chana Mlotek. He describes Yosl’s appearance and praises his “musical” Yiddish. Dr. Zumoff discusses his process of translating Yiddish poetry and defends his preference for retaining rhyme, if possible, in poems that rhyme in the original.&lt;br&gt;	Despite his efforts, Dr. Zumoff acknowledges that the audience for Yiddish literature is very small. He recommends a list of readings for one starting in Yiddish literature. He opines that tensions within the Yiddish world are fading and cites some young people who are still creating Yiddish literature.&lt;br&gt;	Asked about his religious practice, Dr. Zumoff replies that he runs a secular seder (Passover ritual meal), with no recognition of the supernatural. By his definition, many supposedly religious individuals are “fakers.” In summary, he is skeptical that there is or can be a true Yiddish renaissance, but he vows to continue fighting to preserve yidishkayt (a Jewish way of life).</interview_abstract><teaser_text>           	Dr. Barnett Zumoff, a medical doctor by profession and a Yiddish translator and activist, was interviewed by Christa Whitney, December 4, 2013, at his office at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City.	Dr. Zumoff begins by describing his family background.

She explains that her parents emigrated from Eastern Europe, her father from Ukraine around 1908, mainly to avoid being drafted into the tsar’s army; and her mother from Poland, probably after World War I. Zeva then moves on to discuss growing up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and later in East New York (also Brooklyn).

She shares a particular story of how she was able to attend John Dewey’s progressive school for a time because it was free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zeva describes her parents as political “radicals” who were enamored with the Soviet Union. She recalls how her father saw the Soviet Union as a “promised land,” and tells the story of how he actually moved there and obtained a job as director of a children’s theater in Kiev.

Samberg, native of Philadelphia and mother of two, was interviewed by Isaac Daniel Moore on December 15, 2014 in Baltimore, Maryland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elissa grew up in Bucks County on the outskirts of Philadelphia in what she describes as “a split world of the Old Country and pre-war Americana.” She lived in her grandmother’s world in her parents house. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elissa begins the interview describing her family background. Her father’s family came to the United States from Russia before World War Two. Her mother’s family is from Romania, Lithuania, and Russia. They also moved to the United States prior to the outbreak of World War Two. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elissa’s discusses how her grandparents on her mother’s side of the family played an important part in her childhood and how she sees this interview as a tribute to them. She tells the story of how her parents met on the boardwalk in New Jersey. Her mother had a job in a candy story and her father would walk in front of the store everyday, until he worked up the nerve to finally ask her out; they were engaged two weeks later. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in 1956, Elissa describes how she gravitated toward her grandparents while her siblings were embracing modernity in America. She mentions as an example that she didn’t know who Bob Dylan was until she was in her forties. When she was ten her mother fell gravely ill and her grandparents raised her.

Elissa characterizes the culture of the home as “naturally Jewish” and recalls how there were only three ingredients for everything: “a bit of garlic, onion, and salt and pepper.” She recalls how after dinner, the family would have tea and dessert and “everyone would kibits and kibits (gossip and gossip).”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elissa describes how her grandparents influenced the culture of the home she grew up in, a home steeped in Yiddish culture. She tells many stories of her grandfather meeting her after school everyday and walking her home, sneaking shots of “peppermint schnapps” and being in what she terms a “warm and safe environment” with her grandparents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elissa also describes her childhood synagogue, which was founded by her parents in the 1950s, as the epicenter of her world. It was an old building where Elissa recalls finding comfort in the soothing voices of the congregation praying and chanting. Elissa tells a particular story of how a Mr. Krakower helped her with her Bat Mitzvah and how after the ceremony he shared the seven mistakes she had made in the reading. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toward the end, Elissa discusses feeling strongly connected to Yiddish and the Yiddish world her grandparents lived in and wanting to return to it.

Elissa talks about how the relationship between her and her grandchildren is different from the one between her and her grandparents.

February 11, 2015 in Boca Raton, Florida. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger was born in Hagerstown, Maryland and grew up on United States Army bases around the world including, Germany, France, Japan, Russia, and Switzerland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger begins the interview discussing his family’s background. Roger’s father’s family resided in Appalachia and his mother’s family were Jewish immigrants from Russia who left after the 1905 Revolution. Roger’s tells a story of how his mother and father met while studying at New York University in New York City. His mother was a non-observant Jew and never talked about her Jewishness. Roger describes his mother as “wanting to be a modern American woman.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up on army bases around the world, Roger describes the atmosphere of a base as “small town” and discusses having limited contact with the surrounding communities while residing abroad. Roger refers to his upbringing as an “army brat” and tells the story of how Americans on the military base in Japan had their own form of currency separate from that of the American dollar and Japanese yen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger describes his family as small. He had one younger sister and only met one grandparent, his mother’s mother. Roger discusses having little exposure to Jewish culture while growing up. The family only celebrated standard Christian and American holidays such as Christmas, Independence Day, Easter, etc., all in a very secular way. However, Roger describes how his parents’ value of justice and strong stance against anti-Semitism were transmitted to him as a child. Roger recalls the family encountering anti-Semitism while buying a house in California and how that had a big effect on the family. He explains that being Jewish meant standing up against injustice while simultaneously not fully expressing an outward sense of Jewish identity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger discusses his musical interest and background studying with different teachers while growing up abroad and attending Brown University in the 1960s. He describes music as a fantastic gift and describes how teaching music allows one to communicate with others and transmit openness and tolerance. Roger finds this aspect of music important. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger discusses how over forty years ago he made the discovery that his mother’s family was a family of Jewish musicians. He recalls how his grandmother told him about his family’s musical past which he initially believed were made-up stories. His great-grandfather world-renowned cantor, Arye Leyb Schlossberg, who was born in Jekabpils, Latvia and traveled and performed around Europe. His grandmother also sang and so did many other members of the family. Roger describes the discovery as “life-changing” and recalls the shock about how little he knew about his own family. Roger explains how this was the first time he encountered Jewish music and how he became “obsessed” with learning more about his family’s music. Roger began to research his family’s background and met relatives he had not known before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger discusses how when he encountered his great-grandfather’s music, the memory of his family’s musical legacy was forgotten and he began the mission of rehabilitating their music. Some re-discovered music composed by his great-uncle, Isaac Schlossberg, was recently performed in Boston at Harvard University with Zalmen Mlotek and Nahma Sandrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end, Roger discusses how this discovery heightened his interest in Jewish history and culture. He also discusses how it forced him to grapple with the question of Jewish identity when raising his children.

However, Roger describes how his parents’ value of justice and strong stance against anti-Semitism were transmitted to him as a child. Roger recalls the family encountering anti-Semitism while buying a house in California and how that had a big effect on the family. He explains that being Jewish meant standing up against injustice while simultaneously not fully expressing an outward sense of Jewish identity. Roger discusses his musical interest and background studying with different teachers while growing up abroad and attending Brown University in the 1960s. He describes music as a fantastic gift and describes how teaching music allows one to communicate with others and transmit openness and tolerance. Roger finds this aspect of music important. Roger discusses how over forty years ago he made the discovery that his mother’s family was a family of Jewish musicians. He recalls how his grandmother told him about his family’s musical past which he initially believed were made-up stories. His great-grandfather world-renowned cantor, Arye Leyb Schlossberg, who was born in Jekabpils, Latvia and traveled and performed around Europe. His grandmother also sang and so did many other members of the family. Roger describes the discovery as “life-changing” and recalls the shock about how little he knew about his own family. Roger explains how this was the first time he encountered Jewish music and how he became “obsessed” with learning more about his family’s music. Roger began to research his family’s background and met relatives he had not known before. Roger discusses how when he encountered his great-grandfather’s music, the memory of his family’s musical legacy was forgotten and he began the mission of rehabilitating their music. Some re-discovered music composed by his great-uncle, Isaac Schlossberg, was recently performed in Boston at Harvard University with Zalmen Mlotek and Nahma Sandrow. Towards the end, Roger discusses how this discovery heightened his interest in Jewish history and culture. He also discusses how it forced him to grapple with the question of Jewish identity when raising his children. For Roger, learning about his family’s Jewish past has made him aware and appreciative of the diversity of Jewish life and history</teaser_text><interview_location>Boca Raton, FL</interview_location><interview_date>2015-02-11</interview_date><themes>Family history, stories about ancestors,Childhood,Jewish Identity,Yiddish language,Coming back to Yiddish,Other languages,Visual Arts,Music,Dance,Theater,Holocaust,World War Two,Education,Religion and ritual,Israel,Old Country,Eastern Europe,Western Europe,America,United States,Transmission,Anti-Semitism,Roots, heritage,children/grandchildren of Yiddish personalities, Beyond the Books,Yiddish personalities,Shtetl,Travel,</themes><uncontroled_themes>Roger Mason, Russia, Poland, Isaac Schlossburg, 20th Century, Hassidism,</uncontroled_themes><narrator><narrator_full_name>Roger Mason</narrator_full_name><narrator_first_name>Roger</narrator_first_name><narrator_last_name>Mason</narrator_last_name><narrator_birth_year>1944</narrator_birth_year><narrator_place_of_birth>Hagerstown, Maryland </narrator_place_of_birth></narrator></record><record><interview_id>656</interview_id><interview_abstract>Paul Azaroff, Hebrew and Judaic Studies teacher and native of New York City, was interviewed by Isaac Daniel Moore on February 11, 2015 in Boca Raton, Florida.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul was born in New York City in 1934 and grew up in Brooklyn and later Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He begins the interview discussing his family background. Paul’s mother’s family was from Bialystok and immigrated to America in 1929 to join family who had moved before World War One. Paul describes them as Litvaks (Lithuanian Jews) and talks about their strong Litvish (Lithuanian) Yiddish accent. His father’s family came to the United States in 1905 from Belarus; his father was born in New York City in 1908 and grew up on the Lower East Side. Paul tells the story of how his parents met. His father worked for a man named Paul Bernstein who was incidentally married to Paul’s mother’s elder sister. Mr. Bernstein promised Paul’s father partnership in the business if he married his wife’s sister.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul describes his family as large and discusses the “barrier” that existed between his father’s “American” family and his mother’s Jewish-Polish family. He tells the story of how his mother was often times referred to as a “Mocky” (derogatory term for “Jew”). Paul explains that Yiddish was the language of the home. He recalls reading The Forward, The Bialystoker and Der Tog in Yiddish to his mother and bobe (grandmother). Paul explains that he was especially close to his grandmother with whom he always spoke Yiddish. He retells many stories, including about her love of apples and her large earlobes. Paul also talks about the strict kosher dietary rules his mother followed and the special tablecloth she used when lighting candles on Yom Kippur. In one story, he recalls going to the movies and upsetting his mother by bringing popcorn and macaroni and cheese into the house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul recalls joining a left-wing Zionist youth organization, Hashomer Hatzair, at the age of 15 and finding his niche. He discusses reading on Zionism, capitalism, and communism, and singing Yiddish folk songs. Eventually in 1950 Paul persuaded his mother to let him travel to England, France, and Israel to meet cousins who had survived the Holocaust. Paul tells a particular story about meeting a young American boy, a “goy” (non-Jew) from Idaho and befriending him on the Queen Elizabeth I. Paul also recalls a lively encounter with Sholem Asch on the journey from Haifa to Marseille. Paul further discusses the construction of Jewish identity in America versus Israel and elaborates on the sharp divide in Israel between Hebrew and Yiddish. Paul remembers the feeling of having to keep his love of Yiddish “to himself” while in Israel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul talks about his education at the University of Toronto and Hebrew University in Jerusalem and describes his passion for teaching. He further reflects on his need to hear Yiddish in his life which led him to start teaching Yiddish in 1992 and to form a Yiddish club in Delray Beach, Florida. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul discusses how some of his children have embraced a more religiously-oriented Jewish identity and talks about his grandchildren who speak Yiddish with a Litvish accent and how he enjoys hearing it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end, Paul reflects on the role of Yiddish in his life and how it has changed over the years. Paul characterizes Yiddish as “something that you have in your soul which makes it click.” For him, Yiddish is alive when “a mother scolds her child in Yiddish.” Paul offers advice for future generations by reflecting on his mother’s wise words.  &lt;br&gt;</interview_abstract><teaser_text>Paul Azaroff, Hebrew and Judaic Studies teacher and native of New York City, was interviewed by Isaac Daniel Moore on February 11, 2015 in Boca Raton, Florida.Paul was born in New York City in 1934 and grew up in Brooklyn and later Israel.He begins the interview discussing his family background.
